{"id": "10081", "abstract": ["English orthography is the system of writing conventions used to represent spoken English in written form allowing readers to connect the graphemes to sound and to meaning. It includes English s norms of spelling hyphenation capitalisation word breaks emphasis and punctuation. Like the orthography of most world languages English orthography has a broad degree of standardisation. This standardisation began to develop when movable type spread to England in the late 15th century. However unlike with most languages there are multiple ways to spell nearly every phoneme sound and most letters also have multiple pronunciations depending on their position in a word and the context. This is partly due to the large number of words that have been borrowed from a large number of other languages throughout the history of English without successful attempts at complete spelling reforms and partly due to accidents of history such as some of the earliest mass produced English publications being typeset by highly trained multilingual printing compositors who occasionally used a spelling pattern more typical for another language. For example the word ghost was previously spelled gast in English until the Flemish spelling pattern was unintentionally substituted and happened to be accepted. Most of the spelling conventions in Modern English were derived from the phonetic spelling of a variety of Middle English and generally do not reflect the sound changes that have occurred since the late 15th century such as the Great Vowel Shift . As a result of this many words are spelled the way that they were pronounced more than 600 years ago instead of being spelled like they are pronounced in the 21st century. Despite the various English dialects spoken from country to country and within different regions of the same country there are only slight regional variations in English orthography the two most recognised variations being British and American spelling and its overall uniformity helps facilitate international communication. On the other hand it also adds to the discrepancy between the way English is written and spoken in any given location."], "label": ["Society and social sciences", "Culture", "Language"], "title": "English orthography", "headers": ["Function of the letters", "Diacritics", "Ligatures", "Phonic irregularities", "Spelling irregularities", "Spelling patterns", "See also", "References", "Bibliography", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["50711", "22975", "12514", "173533", "13049", "5641", "5920", "5751", "20000187", "22756", "25401", "22667", "22641", "31365", "22926", "4179", "54219", "419686", "1117907", "28489", "11883", "18077", "401482", "1449866", "18852", "12787", "18581264", "29641", "32693", "21566", "237736", "188969", "23247", "18306", "11887", "22209", "14761", "59126", "947774", "20913753", "10081", "3675310", "12872", "45597", "68832", "1438533", "20544", "190054", "23711", "8128", "17730", "378194", "22980", "26247", "21704", "59347", "226990", "21620", "15294269", "344148", "23194", "25389"]}

At 400 meters she is the 2015 world champion 2011 world silver medalist 2016 Olympic silver medalist 2017 world bronze medalist and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist. Across the short distances Felix is a ten time U.S. national champion 2004 2005 2007 2012 2015 and 2016 . Although individual Olympic glory was mostly elusive Felix played a key role on the United States women s relay teams winning six additional Olympic gold medals four consecutive medals at 4 \u00d7 400 meters 2008 2012 2016 and 2020 and two at 4 \u00d7 100 meters 2012 and 2016 .

With these six golds from team relays and one from an individual event Felix became the first female track and field athlete to ever win seven Olympic gold medals. She is also the most decorated woman in Olympic track and field history and the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history having earned 11 total medals from five consecutive Olympic Games. Felix currently holds the title of the most decorated athlete male or female in World Athletics Championship history with 18 career medals 7 from individual events and 11 from team relays. Amongst Felix s notable performances her 200 meters personal best of 21.69 seconds which was set at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials ranked at the time as the third fastest time ever ran by an American woman and sixth fastest time by a female athlete in history. She also ran a 47.72 second leg on the U.S. women s 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay team at the 2015 Beijing World Championships recording the fastest split ever by an American woman and third fastest split ever by a female athlete.

{"id": "1051892", "abstract": ["Io or Jupiter I is the innermost and third largest of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter. Slightly larger than Earth s moon Io is the fourth largest moon in the Solar System has the highest density of any moon the strongest surface gravity of any moon and the lowest amount of water by atomic ratio of any known astronomical object in the Solar System. It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named after the mythological character Io a priestess of Hera who became one of Zeus s lovers. With over 400 active volcanoes Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System. This extreme geologic activity is the result of tidal heating from friction generated within Io s interior as it is pulled between Jupiter and the other Galilean moons Europa Ganymede and Callisto. Several volcanoes produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as above the surface. Io s surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of Io s silicate crust. Some of these peaks are taller than Mount Everest the highest point on Earth s surface. Unlike most moons in the outer Solar System which are mostly composed of water ice Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core. Most of Io s surface is composed of extensive plains with a frosty coating of sulfur and sulfur dioxide. Io s volcanism is responsible for many of its unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various subtle shades of yellow red white black and green largely due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur. Numerous extensive lava flows several more than in length also mark the surface. The materials produced by this volcanism make up Io s thin patchy atmosphere and Jupiter s extensive magnetosphere. Io s volcanic ejecta also produce a large plasma torus around Jupiter. Io played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and 18th centuries discovered in January 1610 by Galileo Galilei along with the other Galilean satellites this discovery furthered the adoption of the Copernican model of the Solar System the development of Kepler s laws of motion and the first measurement of the speed of light. Viewed from Earth Io remained just a point of light until the late 19th and early 20th centuries when it became possible to resolve its large scale surface features such as the dark red polar and bright equatorial regions. In 1979 the two Voyager spacecraft revealed Io to be a geologically active world with numerous volcanic features large mountains and a young surface with no obvious impact craters. The Galileo spacecraft performed several close flybys in the 1990s and early 2000s obtaining data about Io s interior structure and surface composition. These spacecraft also revealed the relationship between Io and Jupiter s magnetosphere and the existence of a belt of high energy radiation centered on Io s orbit. Io receives about 3 600 rem 36 Sv of ionizing radiation per day. Further observations have been made by Cassini Huygens in 2000 New Horizons in 2007 and Juno since 2017 as well as from Earth based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Astronomy", "Astronomical objects"], "title": "Io (moon)", "headers": ["Nomenclature", "Observational history", "Orbit and rotation", "Interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere", "Geology", "Atmosphere", "See also", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["15651", "25856", "36891", "18963754", "390905", "40255", "19937", "19331", "14946", "972457", "43534", "50958", "44474", "74803", "7592", "1067830", "193513", "21347693", "16796", "206542", "36563", "29688374", "12505", "30680", "21438242", "39", "54211", "5215428", "22303", "28538", "183957", "155823", "208430", "5667", "164402", "20627", "43126", "202899", "32781", "22444", "47795", "49658", "15368428", "18426568", "43127", "23416994", "80207", "7070301", "42179", "38198", "1079866", "40203", "9446968", "13208", "34398", "32782", "477661", "31990", "17617", "197767", "19593121", "925638", "50225", "319168", "9264", "24981", "32567", "1105295", "14878", "111194", "26826", "191741", "386596", "66014", "742288", "586839", "8482163", "43427", "37208", "32571", "9228", "10363", "4984440", "44469", "26903", "350666", "47526", "8169", "362631", "14734", "538005", "25657", "88213", "14383139", "31140", "202522", "38930", "4303674", "184726", "145716", "378253", "33306", "30719", "33125", "19600416", "28957716", "31185", "23306251", "24768", "181905", "1099413", "145700", "27114", "30647", "27127", "11062", "864017", "60162", "20479", "344783", "199661", "15022", "6139438", "25916521", "160332", "67941", "18963787", "23055", "527639", "6416", "15736", "45756", "72726"]}

The term often implies sexual attractiveness or desirability but can also be distinct from either. There are many factors which influence one person s attraction to another with physical aspects being one of them. Physical attraction itself includes universal perceptions common to all human cultures such as facial symmetry sociocultural dependent attributes and personal preferences unique to a particular individual. In many cases humans subconsciously attribute positive characteristics such as intelligence and honesty to physically attractive people. From research done in the United States and United Kingdom it was found that the association between intelligence and physical attractiveness is stronger among men than among women. Evolutionary psychologists have tried to answer why individuals who are more physically attractive should also on average be more intelligent and have put forward the notion that both general intelligence and physical attractiveness may be indicators of underlying genetic fitness. A person s physical characteristics can signal cues to fertility and health with statistical modeling studies showing that the facial shape variables that reflect aspects of physiological health including body fat and blood pressure also influence observers perceptions of health. Attending to these factors increases reproductive success furthering the representation of one s genes in the population. Heterosexual men on average tend to be attracted to women who have a youthful appearance and exhibit features such as a symmetrical face full breasts full lips and a low waist hip ratio.

{"id": "1201381", "abstract": ["The apothecaries system or apothecaries weights and measures is a historical system of mass and volume units that were used by physicians and apothecaries for medical recipes and also sometimes by scientists. The English version of the system is closely related to the English troy system of weights the pound and grain being exactly the same in both. It divides a pound into 12 ounces an ounce into 8 drachms and a drachm into 3 scruples of 20 grains each. This exact form of the system was used in the United Kingdom in some of its former colonies it survived well into the 20th century. The apothecaries system of measures is a similar system of volume units based on the fluid ounce. For a long time medical recipes were written in Latin often using special symbols to denote weights and measures. The use of different measure and weight systems depending on the purpose was an almost universal phenomenon in Europe between the decline of the Roman Empire and metrication. This was connected with international commerce especially with the need to use the standards of the target market and to compensate for a common weighing practice that caused a difference between actual and nominal weight. In the 19th century most European countries or cities still had at least a commercial or civil system such as the English avoirdupois system for general trading and a second system such as the troy system for precious metals such as gold and silver. The system for precious metals was usually divided in a different way from the commercial system often using special units such as the carat. More significantly it was often based on different weight standards. The apothecaries system often used the same ounces as the precious metals system although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries pound was divided into its own special units which were inherited via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen 1st and 2nd century from the general purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries weights and the normal commercial weights were different it was not always clear which of the two systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it. In old merchants handbooks the former system is sometimes referred to as the pharmaceutical system and distinguished from the apothecaries system.

{"id": "1266658", "abstract": ["Crystallization or crystallisation is the process by which a solid forms where the atoms or molecules are highly organized into a structure known as a crystal. Some of the ways by which crystals form are precipitating from a solution freezing or more rarely deposition directly from a gas. Attributes of the resulting crystal depend largely on factors such as temperature air pressure and in the case of liquid crystals time of fluid evaporation. Crystallization occurs in two major steps. The first is nucleation the appearance of a crystalline phase from either a supercooled liquid or a supersaturated solvent. The second step is known as crystal growth which is the increase in the size of particles and leads to a crystal state. An important feature of this step is that loose particles form layers at the crystal s surface and lodge themselves into open inconsistencies such as pores cracks etc. The majority of minerals and organic molecules crystallize easily and the resulting crystals are generally of good quality i.e. without visible defects. However larger biochemical particles like proteins are often difficult to crystallize. The ease with which molecules will crystallize strongly depends on the intensity of either atomic forces in the case of mineral substances intermolecular forces organic and biochemical substances or intramolecular forces biochemical substances . Crystallization is also a chemical solid liquid separation technique in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs. In chemical engineering crystallization occurs in a crystallizer.

Only the upper two cloud layers have been observed directly the deeper clouds remain speculative. Above the clouds lie several tenuous layers of photochemical haze. Discrete bright tropospheric clouds are rare on Uranus probably due to sluggish convection in the planet s interior. Nevertheless observations of such clouds were used to measure the planet s zonal winds which are remarkably fast with speeds up to 240 m s.

The 19th century guano trade played a pivotal role in the development of modern input intensive farming but its demand began to decline after the discovery of the Haber Bosch process of nitrogen fixing led to the production of synthetic fertilizers. The demand for guano spurred the human colonization of remote bird islands in many parts of the world resulting in some of the first examples of U.S. colonialism and the expansion of the British Empire. The guano mining process resulted in ecological degradation through the loss of millions of seabirds. Unsustainable guano mining in caves alters cave shape causing bats to abandon the roost. Guano is ecologically important due to its role in dispersing nutrients. Cave ecosystems in particular are often wholly dependent on bats to provide nutrients via their guano which supports bacteria fungi invertebrates and vertebrates.

Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world severe income inequality exists among the population. Hong Kong is a highly developed territory and ranks fourth on the UN Human Development Index.

He first became prominent as a film producer and then as an important figure in the aviation industry. Later in life he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle oddities that were caused in part by his worsening obsessive compulsive disorder OCD chronic pain from a near fatal plane crash and increasing deafness. As a film tycoon Hughes gained fame in Hollywood beginning in the late 1920s when he produced big budget and often controversial films such as The Racket 1928 Hell s Angels 1930 and Scarface 1932 . He later took over the RKO Pictures film studio in 1948 recognized then as one of the Big Five studios of Hollywood s Golden Age although the production company struggled under his control and ultimately ceased operations in 1957. Through his interest in aviation and aerospace travel Hughes formed the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932 hiring numerous engineers designers and defense contractors. He spent the rest of the 1930s and much of the 1940s setting multiple world air speed records and building the Hughes H 1 Racer 1935 and H 4 Hercules the Spruce Goose 1947 the latter being the largest flying boat in history and having the longest wingspan of any aircraft from the time it was built until 2019. He acquired and expanded Trans World Airlines and later acquired Air West renaming it Hughes Airwest. Hughes won the Harmon Trophy on two occasions 1936 and 1938 the Collier Trophy 1938 and the Congressional Gold Medal 1939 all for his achievements in aviation throughout the 1930s. He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1973 and was included in Flying magazine s 2013 list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation ranked at 25. During the 1960s and early 1970s Hughes extended his financial empire to include several major businesses in Las Vegas such as real estate hotels casinos and media outlets. Known at the time as one of the most powerful men in the state of Nevada he is largely credited with transforming Vegas into a more refined cosmopolitan city.

After first contact in 1778 European and American cuisine arrived along with missionaries and whalers who introduced their own foods and built large sugarcane plantations. Christian missionaries brought New England cuisine while whalers introduced salted fish which eventually transformed into the side dish lomilomi salmon. As pineapple and sugarcane plantations grew so did demand for labor bringing many immigrant groups to the Islands between 1850 and 1930. Immigrant workers brought cuisines from China Korea Japan the Philippines Puerto Rico and Portugal after arriving in Hawaii introducing their new foods and influencing the region. The introduction of new ethnic foods such as Chinese char siu bao manapua Portuguese sweet bread and malasadas Puerto Rican pasteles and the Japanese bento combined with the existing indigenous European and American foods in the plantation working environments and in the local communities. This blend of cuisines formed a local food style unique to Hawaii resulting in plantation foods like the plate lunch snacks like Spam musubi and dishes like the loco moco. Shortly after World War II several well known local restaurants opened their doors to serve Hawaiian Food .

{"id": "14828", "abstract": ["In mathematics an isomorphism is a structure preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them. The word isomorphism is derived from the Ancient Greek isos equal and morphe form or shape . The interest in isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects have the same properties excluding further information such as additional structure or names of objects . Thus isomorphic structures cannot be distinguished from the point of view of structure only and may be identified. In mathematical jargon one says that two objects are . An automorphism is an isomorphism from a structure to itself. An isomorphism between two structures is a canonical isomorphism a canonical map that is an isomorphism if there is only one isomorphism between the two structures as it is the case for solutions of a universal property or if the isomorphism is much more natural in some sense than other isomorphisms. For example for every prime number all fields with elements are canonically isomorphic with a unique isomorphism. The isomorphism theorems provide canonical isomorphisms that are not unique. The term is mainly used for algebraic structures. In this case mappings are called homomorphisms and a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective. In various areas of mathematics isomorphisms have received specialized names depending on the type of structure under consideration. For example An isometry is an isomorphism of metric spaces. A homeomorphism is an isomorphism of topological spaces. A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of spaces equipped with a differential structure typically differentiable manifolds. A permutation is an automorphism of a set. In geometry isomorphisms and automorphisms are often called transformations for example rigid transformations affine transformations projective transformations. Category theory which can be viewed as a formalization of the concept of mapping between structures provides a language that may be used to unify the approach to these different aspects of the basic idea. Examples Logarithm and exponential Let be the multiplicative group of positive real numbers and let be the additive group of real numbers. The logarithm function satisfies for all so it is a group homomorphism. The exponential function satisfies for all so it too is a homomorphism. The identities and show that and are inverses of each other. Since is a homomorphism that has an inverse that is also a homomorphism is an isomorphism of groups. The function is an isomorphism which translates multiplication of positive real numbers into addition of real numbers. This facility makes it possible to multiply real numbers using a ruler and a table of logarithms or using a slide rule with a logarithmic scale. Integers modulo 6 Consider the group the integers from 0 to 5 with addition modulo 6. Also consider the group the ordered pairs where the x coordinates can be 0 or 1 and the y coordinates can be 0 1 or 2 where addition in the x coordinate is modulo 2 and addition in the y coordinate is modulo 3. These structures are isomorphic under addition under the following scheme or in general For example which translates in the other system as Even though these two groups look different in that the sets contain different elements they are indeed isomorphic their structures are exactly the same. More generally the direct product of two cyclic groups and is isomorphic to if and only if m and n are coprime per the Chinese remainder theorem.

He played parts of 17 National Hockey League NHL seasons his whole NHL career with the Pittsburgh Penguins from 1984 to 2006 assuming ownership in 1999. Nicknamed The Magnificent One Le Magnifique and Super Mario after the fictional character of the same name he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. A gifted playmaker and fast skater despite his large size Lemieux often beat defencemen with fakes and dekes. Drafted first overall by the Penguins in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft Lemieux led Pittsburgh to consecutive Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. Under his ownership the Penguins won additional titles in 2009 2016 and 2017. He is the only man to have his name on the Cup both as a player and owner. He also led Team Canada to an Olympic gold medal in 2002 a championship at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and a Canada Cup in 1987. He won the Lester B. Pearson Award as the most outstanding player voted by the players four times the Hart Trophy as the NHL s most valuable player MVP during the regular season three times the Art Ross Trophy as the league s points leader six times and the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP in 1991 and 1992. He is the only player to score one goal in each of the five possible situations in a single NHL game a feat he accomplished in 1988. At the time of his retirement he was the NHL s seventh highest career points scorer with 690 goals and 1 033 assists. He ranks second in NHL history with a 0.754 career goals per game average behind only Mike Bossy 0.762 . He ranks second in NHL history with a 1.129 career assists per game average behind only Wayne Gretzky 1.320 . He also ranks second in NHL history with 1.883 points per game average behind only Wayne Gretzky 1.921 . Lemieux was never able to play a full season and during his career he played in 70 or more games in a season on only six occasions four of those seasons were before the age of 25. Lemieux s career was plagued by health problems that limited him to 915 of a possible 1 430 regular season games between the opening of the 1984 85 campaign and the final game of 2005 2006. Lemieux s NHL debut was on October 11 1984 and his final game took place on December 16 2005. His numerous ailments included spinal disc herniation Hodgkin s lymphoma chronic tendinitis of a hip flexor muscle and chronic back pain so severe that other people had to tie his skates. He retired on two occasions due to these health issues first in 1997 after battling lymphoma before returning in 2000 and then a second and final time in 2006 after being diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Lemieux also missed the entire 1994 95 season due to Hodgkin s lymphoma. Despite his lengthy absences from the game his play remained at a high level upon his return to the ice he won the Hart Trophy and scoring title in 1995 96 after sitting out the entire previous season. He was on pace for 188 points but only played in 70 games. He was also a finalist for the Hart Trophy when he made his comeback in 2000. In 1999 he bought the then bankrupt Penguins and their top minor league affiliate the American Hockey League s AHL Wilkes Barre Scranton Penguins and is currently the team s principal owner and chairman. The Hockey Hall of Fame inducted Lemieux immediately after his first retirement in 1997 waiving the normal three year waiting period upon his return in 2000 he became the third Hall of Famer after Gordie Howe and Guy Lafleur to play after being inducted. Lemieux s impact on the NHL has been significant Andrew Conte of the Pittsburgh Tribune Review called him the saviour of the Pittsburgh Penguins and after Lemieux s retirement Wayne Gretzky commented that You don t replace players like Mario Lemieux ... The game will miss him. Bobby Orr called him the most talented player I ve ever seen. Orr along with Bryan Trottier and numerous fans speculated that if Lemieux had not suffered so many issues with his health his on ice achievements would have been much greater.

Others however discount this allegory as unrelated to the parable s original meaning and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus.

{"id": "15655", "abstract": ["The Jurassic is a geologic period and stratigraphic system that spanned from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago Mya to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period approximately Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era and is named after the Jura Mountains where limestone strata from the period were first identified. The start of the Jurassic was marked by the major Triassic Jurassic extinction event associated with the eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. The beginning of the Toarcian Stage started around 183 million years ago and is marked by an extinction event associated with widespread oceanic anoxia ocean acidification and elevated the temperatures likely caused by the eruption of the Karoo Ferrar large igneous provinces. The end of the Jurassic however has no clear boundary with the Cretaceous and is the only boundary between geological periods to remain formally undefined. By the beginning of the Jurassic the supercontinent Pangaea had begun rifting into two landmasses Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south. The climate of the Jurassic was warmer than the present and there were no ice caps. Forests grew close to the poles with large arid expanses in the lower latitudes. On land the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna dominated jointly by dinosauromorph and pseudosuchian archosaurs to one dominated by dinosaurs alone.

{"id": "158986", "abstract": ["The culture of Australia is primarily a Western culture originally derived from Britain but also influenced by the unique geography of Australia and the cultural input of Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander and other Australian people. The British colonisation of Australia began in 1788 and waves of multi ethnic migration followed. Evidence of a significant Anglo Celtic heritage includes the predominance of the English language the existence of a democratic system of government drawing upon the British traditions of Westminster government parliamentarianism and constitutional monarchy American constitutionalist and federalist traditions and Christianity as the dominant religion. Aboriginal people are believed to have arrived as early as 60 000 years ago and evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia dates back at least 30 000 years. Several states and territories had their origins as penal colonies with the first British convicts arriving at Sydney Cove in 1788. Stories of outlaws like the bushranger Ned Kelly have endured in Australian music cinema and literature. The Australian gold rushes from the 1850s brought wealth as well as new social tensions to Australia including the miners Eureka Stockade rebellion. The colonies established elected parliaments and rights for workers and women before most other Western nations. Federation in 1901 was the culmination of a growing sense of national identity that had developed over the latter half of the 19th century as seen in the works of the Heidelberg School painters and writers like Banjo Paterson Henry Lawson and Dorothea Mackellar. The World Wars profoundly impacted Australia s national identity with World War I introducing the ANZAC legend and World War II seeing a reorientation from Britain to the United States as the nation s foremost ally. After the second war 6.5 million migrants from 200 nations brought immense new diversity.

{"id": "159273", "abstract": ["The United States invasion of Grenada began at dawn on 25 October 1983. The U.S. and a coalition of six Caribbean nations invaded the island nation of Grenada north of Venezuela. Codenamed Operation Urgent Fury by the U.S. military it resulted in military occupation within a few days. It was triggered by the strife within the People s Revolutionary Government which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada Maurice Bishop and the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council with Hudson Austin as Chairman. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government followed by elections in 1984. Grenada had gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The communist New Jewel Movement seized power in a coup in 1979 under Maurice Bishop suspending the constitution and detaining several political prisoners. In September 1983 an internal power struggle began over Bishop s leadership performance. Bishop was pressured at a party meeting to share power with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop initially agreed but later balked. He was put under house arrest by his own party s Central Committee until he relented. When his secret detention became widely known Bishop was freed by an aroused crowd of his supporters. A confrontation then ensued at military headquarters between Grenadian soldiers loyal to Coard and civilians supporting Bishop. Shooting started under still disputed circumstances. At least 19 soldiers and civilians were killed on 19 October 1983 including Bishop his partner Jacqueline Creft two other cabinet ministers and two union leaders. The Reagan administration in the U.S. launched a military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. In addition the Governor General of Grenada Paul Scoon secretly signaled he would also support outside intervention but he put off signing a letter of invitation until 26 October. Reagan also acted due to concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island and fears of a repeat of the Iran hostage crisis. The invasion began on the morning of 25 October 1983 just two days after the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. The invading force consisted of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the US Army s 75th Ranger Regiment the 82nd Airborne and the Army s rapid deployment force Marines Army Delta Force Navy SEALs and ancillary forces totaling 7 600 troops together with Jamaican forces and troops of the Regional Security System RSS . The force defeated Grenadian resistance after a low altitude airborne assault by Rangers and the 82nd Airborne on Point Salines Airport at the south end of the island and a Marine helicopter and amphibious landing on the north end at Pearls Airport. Austin s military government was deposed and replaced with Scoon as Governor General by an interim advisory council until the 1984 elections. The invasion was criticized by many countries. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher privately disapproved of the mission and the lack of notice that she received but she publicly supported it. The United Nations General Assembly condemned it as a flagrant violation of international law on 2 November 1983 by a vote of 108 to 9. The date of the invasion is now a national holiday in Grenada called Thanksgiving Day commemorating the freeing of several political prisoners who were subsequently elected to office. A truth and reconciliation commission was launched in 2000 to re examine some of the controversies of the era in particular the commission made an unsuccessful attempt to find Bishop s body which had been disposed of at Austin s order and never found. The invasion also highlighted issues with communication and coordination between the different branches of the American military when operating together as a joint force contributing to investigations and sweeping changes in the form of the Goldwater Nichols Act and other reorganizations."], "label": ["History", "History", "20th century"], "title": "United States invasion of Grenada", "headers": ["History", "Outcome", "Legality of the invasion", "Reaction in the United States", "International reaction", "Aftermath", "Order of battle", "See also", "Notes", "Primary sources", "Further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["19344515", "273319", "8269757", "19278686", "633574", "443561", "12129", "891713", "25433", "31956", "236466", "50122", "1066946", "435573", "102226", "53029", "31957", "361176", "243545", "19831", "1082369", "21175158", "325329", "22788", "3524766", "192920", "243433", "1771448", "435568", "395100", "32611", "38301", "12153654", "39768", "30680", "5691012", "6590", "17238662", "3455", "265845", "32374", "31600", "7697", "31717", "18603579"]}

The proliferation of the Internet and smartphones has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century. This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels as people increasingly consume news through e readers smartphones and other personal electronic devices as opposed to the more traditional formats of newspapers magazines or television news channels.

Jerome was born at Stridon a village near Emona on the border of Dalmatia and Pannonia. He is best known for his translation of most of the Bible into Latin the translation that became known as the Vulgate and his commentaries on the whole Bible. Jerome attempted to create a translation of the Old Testament based on a Hebrew version rather than the Septuagint as Latin Bible translations used to be performed before him. His list of writings is extensive and beside his Biblical works he wrote polemical and historical essays always from a theologian s perspective. Jerome was known for his teachings on Christian moral life especially to those living in cosmopolitan centers such as Rome. In many cases he focused his attention on the lives of women and identified how a woman devoted to Jesus should live her life. This focus stemmed from his close patron relationships with several prominent female ascetics who were members of affluent senatorial families.

After escaping Oliver travels to London where he meets the Artful Dodger a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin.

In an early example of the social novel Dickens satirises child labour domestic violence the recruitment of children as criminals and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s.

While he cultivated a cavalier image red lined gray cape the yellow waist sash of a regular cavalry officer hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume red flower in his lapel often sporting cologne his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of Robert E. Lee s army and inspired Southern morale. Stuart graduated from West Point in 1854 and served in Texas and Kansas with the U.S. Army. Stuart was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with Native Americans and the violence of Bleeding Kansas and he participated in the capture of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. He resigned his commission when his home state of Virginia seceded to serve in the Confederate Army first under Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the Army of Northern Virginia playing a role in all of that army s campaigns until his death. He established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions during the Peninsula Campaign and the Maryland Campaign circumnavigated the Union Army of the Potomac bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the North. At the Battle of Chancellorsville he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded Stonewall Jackson s infantry corps. Stuart s most famous campaign the Gettysburg Campaign was flawed when his long separation from Lee s army left Lee unaware of Union troop movements so that Lee was surprised and almost trapped at the Battle of Gettysburg. Stuart received significant criticism from the Southern press as well as the proponents of the Lost Cause movement after the war. During the 1864 Overland Campaign Union Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan s cavalry launched an offensive to defeat Stuart who was mortally wounded at the Battle of Yellow Tavern. In 1855 he had married Flora Cooke.

{"id": "16829895", "abstract": ["Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants Variola major and Variola minor . The agent of variola virus VARV belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus. The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977 and the World Health Organization WHO certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980. The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting. This was followed by formation of ulcers in the mouth and a skin rash. Over a number of days the skin rash turned into characteristic fluid filled blisters with a dent in the center. The bumps then scabbed over and fell off leaving scars. The disease was spread between people or via contaminated objects. Prevention was achieved mainly through the smallpox vaccine. Once the disease had developed certain antiviral medication may have helped. The risk of death was about 30 with higher rates among babies. Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin and some were left blind. The origin of smallpox is unknown however the earliest evidence of the disease dates to the 3rd century BCE in Egyptian mummies. The disease historically occurred in outbreaks. In 18th century Europe it is estimated that 400 000 people died from the disease per year and that one third of all cases of blindness were due to smallpox. Smallpox is estimated to have killed up to 300 million people in the 20th century and around 500 million people in the last 100 years of its existence. Earlier deaths included six European monarchs. As recently as 1967 15 million cases occurred a year. Inoculation for smallpox appears to have started in China around the 1500s. Europe adopted this practice from Asia in the first half of the 18th century. In 1796 Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine.

Born in Buenos Aires Argentina Bergoglio worked for a time as a bouncer and a janitor as a young man before training to be a chemist and working as a technician in a food science laboratory. After recovering from a severe illness he was inspired to join the Society of Jesus the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969 and from 1973 to 1979 was the Jesuit provincial superior in Argentina. He became the archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. He led the Argentine Church during the December 2001 riots in Argentina. The administrations of N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner considered him to be a political rival. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013 a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Throughout his public life Francis has been noted for his humility emphasis on God s mercy international visibility as pope concern for the poor and commitment to interreligious dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors for instance choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by previous popes. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding abortion clerical celibacy and the ordination of women but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of deaconesses and has made women full members of dicasteries in the Roman Curia. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming for members of the LGBT community. Francis is an outspoken critic of unbridled capitalism and free market economics consumerism and overdevelopment and advocates taking action on climate change a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of Laudato si . In international diplomacy he helped to restore full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and supported the cause of refugees during the European and Central American migrant crises. Since 2018 he has been an opponent of populism. He has faced criticism from theological conservatives on many questions including his promotion of ecumenism as well as admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to communion with the publication of Amoris laetitia ."], "label": ["People", "Religious figures", "Christianity"], "title": "Pope Francis", "headers": ["Early years", "Jesuit (1958\u20132013)", "Relations with Argentine governments", "Papacy (2013\u2013present)", "Theological emphases", "Controversies", "International diplomatic role", "Public image", "Distinctions", "Coat of arms", "Writings", "Music album", "Films", "See also", "Notes", "References", "Bibliography", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["5478", "16005", "10568", "9581", "25645", "25458", "308790", "72009", "5058690", "76835", "1520", "15414", "59205", "26538", "42085878", "25584621", "5211", "18935732", "55284", "136566", "29833", "592794", "62028", "5042481", "30680", "1192711", "279641", "32817", "7515849", "12471", "79515", "7175", "209982", "820137", "273319", "16043", "232595", "4312", "144364", "73513", "9282173", "10277", "28436", "59210523", "19085400", "65689", "241405", "172717", "68187748", "61008894", "2633994", "23805", "396249", "60857", "2397", "4041", "18998750", "13393", "340239", "16083", "233567", "108956", "23056", "195152", "17633", "14579", "25441", "4848272", "69328", "30158", "31843", "230189", "746", "221749", "19344515", "12490", "17643", "13828", "19291", "7161476", "211484", "5416", "49607", "22921", "30636", "229447", "19283178", "39660", "102226", "5405", "5843419", "5042951", "32408", "3466", "52135", "48139", "3470", "19457", "534366", "12492", "17730", "338256", "13373", "62750956", "173070", "606848", "18950756", "31591547", "241269", "348361", "9334", "26786", "261273", "32902", "26636309", "25061", "262752", "70149799", "41188263", "5589718", "6037917", "49966", "51572", "255932", "310344", "34276", "31783", "37787", "28134", "255919", "8504", "11638", "30242372", "52966258", "914259", "46950", "215586", "255589", "89852", "83895", "765430", "1644780", "1471587", "13658", "292259", "7515928", "670569", "471806", "146656", "3463", "31600", "294894"]}

It is spread easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People are infectious from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits. Those treated with antibiotics are no longer infectious after five days. Diagnosis is by collecting a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This sample can then be tested by either culture or by polymerase chain reaction. Prevention is mainly by vaccination with the pertussis vaccine. Initial immunization is recommended between six and eight weeks of age with four doses to be given in the first two years of life. Protection from pertussis decreases over time so additional doses of vaccine are often recommended for older children and adults. Antibiotics may be used to prevent the disease in those who have been exposed and are at risk of severe disease. In those with the disease antibiotics are useful if started within three weeks of the initial symptoms but otherwise have little effect in most people. In pregnant women and children less than one year old antibiotics are recommended within six weeks of symptom onset. Antibiotics used include erythromycin azithromycin clarithromycin or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Evidence to support interventions for the cough other than antibiotics is poor. About 50 of infected children less than a year old require hospitalization and nearly 0.5 1 in 200 die. An estimated 16.3 million people worldwide were infected in 2015. Most cases occur in the developing world and people of all ages may be affected. In 2015 pertussis resulted in 58 700 deaths down from 138 000 deaths in 1990. Outbreaks of the disease were first described in the 16th century. The bacterium that causes the infection was discovered in 1906. The pertussis vaccine became available in the 1940s."], "label": ["Biological and health sciences", "Health", "Morbidity"], "title": "Whooping cough", "headers": ["Signs and symptoms", "Cause", "Mechanism", "Diagnosis", "Prevention", "Treatment", "Prognosis", "Epidemiology", "History", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["64646", "273319", "13292", "17238607", "45831", "41347987", "23647", "683026", "299641", "58937", "1805", "10090", "42730", "62028", "30680", "34439", "33583", "32473", "24838", "15464966", "2143933", "45358446", "92693", "14958", "22984", "9096372", "3138"]}

Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease. Other animals are not involved. Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms. Occasionally a throat or stool sample may be tested for the virus. Handwashing may prevent spread and those infected should not go to work daycare or school. No antiviral medication or vaccine is available but development efforts are underway. Most cases require no specific treatment. Simple pain medication such as ibuprofen or numbing mouth gel may be used. Occasionally intravenous fluids are given to children who are unable to drink enough.

In research on the topic such as Nicholas Goodrick Clarke s book The Occult Roots of Nazism the term Ariosophy is generically used to describe the Aryan esoteric theories of a subset of the V\u00f6lkische Bewegung . This broader use of the word is retrospective and it was not generally current among the esotericists themselves. List actually called his doctrine Armanism while Lanz used the terms Theozoology and Ario Christianity before the First World War. The ideas of Von List and Lanz von Liebenfels were part of a general occult revival that occurred in Austria and Germany during the late 19th and early 20th centuries a revival was loosely inspired by Christianity historical Germanic paganism and holistic philosophy as well as by esoteric concepts that were influenced by German romanticism and Theosophy.

The son of a distinguished general Edward Wolfe he received his first commission at a young age and saw extensive service in Europe during the War of the Austrian Succession. His service in Flanders and in Scotland where he took part in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion brought him to the attention of his superiors. The advancement of his career was halted by the Peace Treaty of 1748 and he spent much of the next eight years on garrison duty in the Scottish Highlands. Already a brigade major at the age of 18 he was a lieutenant colonel by 23. The outbreak of the Seven Years War in 1756 offered Wolfe fresh opportunities for advancement. His part in the aborted raid on Rochefort in 1757 led William Pitt to appoint him second in command of an expedition to capture the Fortress of Louisbourg. Following the success of the siege of Louisbourg he was made commander of a force which sailed up the Saint Lawrence River to capture Quebec City. After a long siege Wolfe defeated a French force under the Marquis de Montcalm allowing British forces to capture the city. Wolfe was killed at the height of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham due to injuries from three musket balls. Wolfe s part in the taking of Quebec in 1759 earned him lasting fame and he became an icon of Britain s victory in the Seven Years War and subsequent territorial expansion.

It is the 20th smallest by area and the 25th most populous of the 50 U.S. states. Louisiana is bordered by the state of Texas to the west Arkansas to the north Mississippi to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. A large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River. Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes which are equivalent to counties making it one of only two U.S. states not subdivided into counties the other being Alaska and its boroughs . The state s capital is Baton Rouge and its largest city is New Orleans. Much of the state s lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota typical examples include birds such as ibises and egrets. There are also many species of tree frogs and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state including four that are federally recognized ten that are state recognized and four that have not received recognition. Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural multilingual heritage being so strongly influenced by a mixture of 18th century French Saint Dominican Spanish French Canadian Acadian Native American and African cultures that they are considered to be exceptional in the U.S. Before the American purchase of the territory in 1803 the present day U.S. state of Louisiana had been both a French colony and for a brief period a Spanish one. In addition colonists imported various African peoples as slaves in the 18th century. Many came from peoples of the same region of West Africa thus concentrating their culture Filipinos also arrived during colonial Louisiana. In the post Civil War environment Anglo Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization and in 1921 English was for a time made the sole language of instruction in Louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was revived in 1974. There has never been an official language in Louisiana and the state constitution enumerates the right of the people to preserve foster and promote their respective historic linguistic and cultural origins. Based on national averages Louisiana frequently ranks low among the U.S. in terms of health education and development and high in measures of poverty. In 2018 Louisiana was ranked as the least healthy state in the country with high levels of drug related deaths and excessive alcohol consumption while it has had the highest homicide rate in the United States since at least the 1990s."], "label": ["Geography", "Countries", "Regions and country subdivisions"], "title": "Louisiana", "headers": ["Etymology", "History", "Geography", "Demographics", "Economy", "Culture", "Education", "Transportation", "Law and government", "National Guard", "Sports", "Notable people", "See also", "Notes", "References", "Bibliography", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["655311", "19977", "2154", "21883857", "47384", "483360", "22388", "863", "88366", "22199", "57391", "32304", "37530", "1279493", "484254", "21182", "24909346", "5254", "19468510", "461407", "26840", "1890", "624", "3382", "23604120", "14849", "640895", "30680", "34059", "21709", "16949861", "220776", "18956035", "93560", "39062", "16772", "29810", "32070", "49001", "57835", "23195", "13873779", "19579", "19039354", "23546455", "85023", "47777152", "307491", "208611", "25459", "51513", "1845092", "5623", "7023", "21785", "8672486", "2569378", "215913", "55040", "93941", "50845", "32927", "21211", "296328", "216485", "117407", "183968", "26364", "31756", "327786", "12343", "92656", "19169", "762556", "181337", "22518", "29402", "150473", "17628", "1705548", "1783987", "1870337", "18618239", "60343", "267370", "3434750", "429833", "168540", "93768", "3267529", "102446", "30795", "999895", "46523", "26961", "31737", "21786641", "60961", "43024", "60089", "198843", "9696", "401342", "27718", "5717", "277905", "11867", "1570983", "12010", "15978", "11188", "307925", "323777", "606848", "189917", "23310", "34681", "8210131", "194242", "102024", "22093", "62529", "23071", "32511", "29922", "4240766", "1930", "73162", "16234880", "5407", "11232", "6037917", "8282374", "13543", "612166", "1048798", "75763", "26036", "5043544", "53842", "348454", "21184", "67393", "16779", "4721", "1228152", "15247542", "25814008", "62784", "18307757", "19283335", "15624", "21076367", "216862", "21217", "717", "237945", "22719", "192309", "21171721", "158019", "307", "4459227", "51054", "86359", "484824", "18952739"]}

Competition can arise between entities such as organisms individuals economic and social groups etc. The rivalry can be over attainment of any exclusive goal including recognition e.g. awards goods mates status prestige leadership market share niches and scarce resources or a territory. Competition occurs in nature between living organisms which co exist in the same environment. Animals compete over water supplies food mates and other biological resources. Humans usually compete for food and mates though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth power prestige and fame when in a static repetitive or unchanging environment. Competition is a major tenet of market economies and business often associated with business competition as companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. Competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop. Competition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation however in the real world mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm. In economies as the philosopher R. G. Collingwood argued the presence of these two opposites together is essential to an economic system. The parties to an economic action co operate in competing like two chess players . Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as game theory. Competition has been studied in several fields including psychology sociology and anthropology. Social psychologists for instance study the nature of competition. They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. They also study group dynamics to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. Sociologists meanwhile study the effects of competition on society as a whole.

Groups may sometimes be combined into supergroups. Groups are useful for showing relationships between formations and they are also useful for small scale mapping or for studying the stratigraphy of large regions. Geologists exploring a new area have sometimes defined groups when they believe the strata within the groups can be divided into formations during subsequent investigations of the area. It is possible for only some of the strata making up a group to be divided into formations. An example of a group is the Glen Canyon Group which includes in ascending order the Wingate Sandstone the Moenave Formation the Kayenta Formation and the Navajo Sandstone. Each of the formations can be distinguished from its neighbor by its lithology but all were deposited in the same vast erg. Not all these formations are present in all areas where the Glen Canyon Group is present. Another example of a group is the Vadito Group of northern New Mexico. Although many of its strata have been divided into formations such as the Glenwoody Formation other strata particularly in the lower part of the group remain undivided into formations. Some well known groups of northwestern Europe have in the past also been used as units for chronostratigraphy and geochronology.

It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric. Different types of stars have different types of stellar winds. Post main sequence stars nearing the ends of their lives often eject large quantities of mass in massive solar masses per year slow v 10 km s winds. These include red giants and supergiants and asymptotic giant branch stars. These winds are understood to be driven by radiation pressure on dust condensing in the upper atmosphere of the stars. Young T Tauri stars often have very powerful stellar winds. Massive stars of types O and B have stellar winds with lower mass loss rates solar masses per year but very high velocities v 1 2000 km s . Such winds are driven by radiation pressure on the resonance absorption lines of heavy elements such as carbon and nitrogen. These high energy stellar winds blow stellar wind bubbles. G type stars like the Sun have a wind driven by their hot magnetized corona. The Sun s wind is called the solar wind. These winds consist mostly of high energy electrons and protons about 1 keV that are able to escape the star s gravity because of the high temperature of the corona. Stellar winds from main sequence stars do not strongly influence the evolution of lower mass stars such as the Sun. However for more massive stars such as O stars the mass loss can result in a star shedding as much as 50 of its mass whilst on the main sequence this clearly has a significant impact on the later stages of evolution. The influence can even be seen for intermediate mass stars which will become white dwarfs at the ends of their lives rather than exploding as supernovae only because they lost enough mass in their winds."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Astronomy", "Stellar astronomy"], "title": "Stellar wind", "headers": ["See also", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["19605", "28927", "7839", "26808", "27680", "23317", "535458", "38579", "2178570", "177174", "21245707", "47687", "43709", "39674", "183932", "33501", "1118042", "26751", "200011", "28538", "20647050"]}

The Everglades are a network of wetlands and forests fed by a river flowing per day out of Lake Okeechobee southwest into Florida Bay. The park is the most significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere. Thirty six threatened or protected species inhabit the park including the Florida panther the American crocodile and the West Indian manatee along with 350 species of birds 300 species of fresh and saltwater fish 40 species of mammals and 50 species of reptiles. The majority of South Florida s fresh water which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer is recharged in the park. Humans have lived for thousands of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934 to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades and dedicated in 1947 as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida.

It has a close shared cultural history with three other island regions the Philippines to the west Polynesia to the east and Melanesia to the south as well as with the wider community of Austronesian peoples. The region has a tropical marine climate and is part of the Oceanian realm. It includes four main archipelagos the Caroline Islands the Gilbert Islands the Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands as well as numerous islands that are not part of any archipelago. Political control of areas within Micronesia varies depending on the island and is distributed among six sovereign nations. Some of the Caroline Islands are part of the Republic of Palau and some are part of the Federated States of Micronesia often shortened to FSM or Micronesia not to be confused with the identical name for the overall region . The Gilbert Islands along with the Phoenix Islands and the Line Islands in Polynesia comprise the Republic of Kiribati. The Mariana Islands are affiliated with the United States some of them belong to the U.S. Territory of Guam and the rest belong to the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The island of Nauru is its own sovereign nation. The Marshall Islands all belong to the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The sovereignty of Wake Island is contested it is claimed both by the United States and by the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The United States has actual possession of Wake Island which is under the immediate administration of the United States Air Force. Human settlement of Micronesia began several millennia ago. The Micronesian people are considered by linguistic archaeological and human genetic evidence a subset of the sea migrating Austronesian people who include the Polynesian people and the Melanesian people. Based on the current scientific consensus the Austronesian peoples originated from a prehistoric seaborne migration known as the Austronesian expansion from pre Han Taiwan at around 3000 to 1500 BCE. Austronesians reached the northernmost Philippines specifically the Batanes Islands by around 2200 BCE. Austronesians were the first people to invent oceangoing sailing technologies notably catamarans outrigger boats lashed lug boat building and the crab claw sail which enabled their rapid dispersal into the islands of the Indo Pacific. From 2000 BCE they assimilated or were assimilated by the earlier populations on the islands in their migration pathway. The earliest known contact of Europeans with Micronesia was in 1521 when Spanish ships landed in the Marianas.

From an Islamic standpoint there is an uncompromising monotheism at the heart of the Islamic beliefs aqidah which is seen as distinguishing Islam from other major religions. Moreover Tawhid requires Muslims not only to avoid worshiping multiple gods but also to relinquish striving for money social status or egoism. The Qur an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world a unique independent and indivisible being who is independent of the entire creation. God according to Islam is a universal God rather than a local tribal or parochial one God is an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.

{"id": "19356", "abstract": ["A mental disorder also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Such features may be persistent relapsing and remitting or occur as single episodes. Many disorders have been described with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional usually a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. The causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves feels perceives or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs as well as social norms should be taken into account when making a diagnosis. Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists psychologists psychiatric nurses and clinical social workers using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options. Other treatments include lifestyle changes social interventions peer support and self help. In a minority of cases there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression. In 2019 common mental disorders around the globe include depression which affects about 264 million bipolar disorder which affects about 45 million dementia which affects about 50 million and schizophrenia and other psychoses which affects about 20 million people.

{"id": "19591", "abstract": ["The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of the Eastern Centennial Mountains of Southwestern Montana the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis Missouri. The river drains a sparsely populated semi arid watershed of more than 500 000 square miles 1 300 000 km2 which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer than the Mississippi above the confluence and carries a comparable volume of water. When combined with the lower Mississippi River it forms the world s fourth longest river system. For over 12 000 years people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains. The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century. The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails. Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s first by covered wagon then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river. Conflict between settlers and Native Americans in the watershed led to some of the most longstanding and violent of the American Indian Wars. During the 20th century the Missouri River basin was extensively developed for irrigation flood control and the generation of hydroelectric power. Fifteen dams impound the main stem of the river with hundreds more on tributaries. Meanders have been cut off and the river channelized to improve navigation reducing its length by almost from pre development times. Although the lower Missouri valley is now a populous and highly productive agricultural and industrial region heavy development has taken its toll on wildlife and fish populations as well as water quality."], "label": ["Geography", "Physical", "Bodies of water"], "title": "Missouri River", "headers": ["Course", "Watershed", "Geology", "First people", "Early European explorers", "American frontier", "Dam-building era", "Navigation", "Ecology", "Tourism and recreation", "See also", "Notes", "References", "Works cited", "Further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["21647", "145792", "477522", "7954867", "19011", "567471", "19978", "569881", "5816", "22388", "863", "70807", "230342", "201203", "5408", "922554", "21139", "386555", "102739", "133495", "26840", "624", "14849", "218630", "93571", "178690", "186112", "25198", "191162", "31716", "445407", "15361", "39062", "14607", "125317", "19579", "78147", "3335767", "85023", "885835", "25459", "33611", "27687", "91983", "5615", "7023", "46159", "20110668", "57841", "215913", "571662", "26746", "27772", "23291", "17615", "20049582", "31756", "266221", "34286", "26810748", "19322", "17748", "17946", "57846", "1477664", "17628", "4177", "607459", "201401", "224915", "60343", "34340", "123654", "3434750", "58635", "51056", "3720257", "165261", "267577", "66706", "29469", "57853", "19283361", "13435", "18842395", "53879", "180968", "249853", "478839", "252507", "51518", "57842", "3345336", "2402376", "19594534", "48711", "2191711", "23310", "7999492", "21651", "17454", "170406", "43600", "16716", "29922", "8522", "13297", "1302978", "197739", "45948", "51464", "150045", "19571", "482626", "58296", "6719", "52259", "1415891", "285954", "16829895", "4649165", "27982", "18600991", "37401", "19283335", "49725", "381399", "267896", "717", "70117", "15716239"]}

The MBTA and Philadelphia s Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority SEPTA are the only US transit agencies that operate all five major types of terrestrial mass transit vehicles light rail vehicles the Ashmont Mattapan High Speed and Green Lines rapid transit trains the Blue Orange and Red Lines regional rail trains the Commuter Rail electric trolleybuses part of the Silver Line and motor buses MBTA bus . In 2016 the system averaged 1 277 200 passengers per weekday of which heavy rail averaged 552 500 and the light rail lines 226 500 making it the fourth busiest subway system and the busiest light rail system in the United States by boardings per mile. As of late 2019 average weekday ridership of the commuter rail system was 119 800 making it the sixth busiest commuter rail system in the U.S. The MBTA is the largest consumer of electricity in Massachusetts and the second largest land owner after the Department of Conservation and Recreation .

{"id": "20369", "abstract": ["In cell biology mitosis is a part of the cell cycle in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. Therefore mitosis is also known as equational division . In general mitosis is preceded by S phase of interphase during which DNA replication occurs and is often followed by telophase and cytokinesis which divides the cytoplasm organelles and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. The different stages of mitosis altogether define the mitotic M phase of an animal cell cycle the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other. The process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These stages are preprophase specific to plant cells prophase prometaphase metaphase anaphase and telophase. During mitosis the chromosomes which have already duplicated condense and attach to spindle fibers that pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell. The result is two genetically identical daughter nuclei. The rest of the cell may then continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells. The different phases of mitosis can be visualized in real time using live cell imaging. Producing three or more daughter cells instead of the normal two is a mitotic error called tripolar mitosis or multipolar mitosis direct cell triplication multiplication . Other errors during mitosis can induce apoptosis programmed cell death or cause mutations. Certain types of cancer can arise from such mutations. Mitosis occurs only in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells which lack a nucleus divide by a different process called binary fission. Mitosis varies between organisms. For example animal cells undergo an open mitosis where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate whereas fungi undergo a closed mitosis where chromosomes divide within an intact cell nucleus. Most animal cells undergo a shape change known as mitotic cell rounding to adopt a near spherical morphology at the start of mitosis. Most human cells are produced by mitotic cell division.

{"id": "2052", "abstract": ["In computer science an array data structure or simply an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements values or variables each identified by at least one array index or key . An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array also called one dimensional array. For example an array of 10 32 bit 4 byte integer variables with indices 0 through 9 may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000 2004 2008 ... 2036 in hexadecimal 0x7D0 0x7D4 0x7D8 ... 0x7F4 so that the element with index i has the address 2000 i \u00d7 4 . The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address foundation address or base address. Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two dimensional grid two dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term vector is used in computing to refer to an array although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays especially lookup tables the word table is sometimes used as a synonym of array . Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices the memory is a one dimensional array of words whose indices are their addresses. Processors especially vector processors are often optimized for array operations. Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements and hence the element addressing formula are usually but not always fixed while the array is in use. The term array is often used to mean array data type a kind of data type provided by most high level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run time. Array types are often implemented by array structures however in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables linked lists search trees or other data structures.

{"id": "20728", "abstract": ["The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are those mathematical formalisms that permit a rigorous description of quantum mechanics. This mathematical formalism uses mainly a part of functional analysis especially Hilbert spaces which are a kind of linear space. Such are distinguished from mathematical formalisms for physics theories developed prior to the early 1900s by the use of abstract mathematical structures such as infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces L 2 space mainly and operators on these spaces. In brief values of physical observables such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as values of functions on phase space but as eigenvalues more precisely as spectral values of linear operators in Hilbert space. These formulations of quantum mechanics continue to be used today. At the heart of the description are ideas of quantum state and quantum observables which are radically different from those used in previous models of physical reality. While the mathematics permits calculation of many quantities that can be measured experimentally there is a definite theoretical limit to values that can be simultaneously measured. This limitation was first elucidated by Heisenberg through a thought experiment and is represented mathematically in the new formalism by the non commutativity of operators representing quantum observables. Prior to the development of quantum mechanics as a separate theory the mathematics used in physics consisted mainly of formal mathematical analysis beginning with calculus and increasing in complexity up to differential geometry and partial differential equations. Probability theory was used in statistical mechanics. Geometric intuition played a strong role in the first two and accordingly theories of relativity were formulated entirely in terms of differential geometric concepts. The phenomenology of quantum physics arose roughly between 1895 and 1915 and for the 10 to 15 years before the development of quantum mechanics around 1925 physicists continued to think of quantum theory within the confines of what is now called classical physics and in particular within the same mathematical structures.

Development began in 1993 in partnership with Silicon Graphics using the codename Project Reality then a test model and arcade platform called Ultra 64. The final design was named after its 64 bit CPU which aided in the console s 3D capabilities. Its design was mostly complete by mid 1995 and launch was delayed until 1996 for the completion of the launch games Super Mario 64 Pilotwings 64 and Saiky Habu Sh gi exclusive to Japan . The charcoal gray console was followed by a series of color variants. Some games require the Expansion Pak accessory to increase system RAM from 4MB to 8MB for improved graphics and functionality. The console mainly supports saved game storage either onboard cartridges or on the Controller Pak accessory. The 64DD peripheral drive hosts both exclusive games and expansion content for cartridges with many further accessories plus the defunct Internet service Randnet but it was a commercial failure and was only released in Japan. Time named it Machine of the Year in 1996 and in 2015 IGN named it the ninth greatest video game console of all time. The Nintendo 64 was discontinued in 2002 following the 2001 launch of its successor the GameCube.

During its existence the empire expanded into modern day southern Vietnam Cambodia and Laos through a continuation of the centuries long Nam ti n and Siamese Vietnamese wars. After 1883 the Nguy n emperors ruled nominally as heads of state of the French protectorates of Annam and Tonkin until the final months of WWII they later nominally ruled over the Empire of Vietnam until the Japanese surrender. The Nguy n Ph\u00fac family established feudal rule over large amounts of territory as the Nguy n Lords by the 16th century before defeating the T\u00e2y S n dynasty and establishing their own imperial rule in the 19th century. The dynastic rule began with Gia Long ascending the throne in 1802 after ending the previous T\u00e2y S n dynasty. The Nguy n dynasty was gradually absorbed by France over the course of several decades in the latter half of the 19th century beginning with the Cochinchina Campaign in 1858 which led to the occupation of the southern area of Vietnam. A series of unequal treaties followed the occupied territory became the French colony of Cochinchina in the 1862 Treaty of Saigon and the 1863 Treaty of Hu gave France access to Vietnamese ports and increased control of its foreign affairs. Finally the 1883 and 1884 Treaties of Hu divided the remaining Vietnamese territory into the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin under nominal Nguy n Ph\u00fac rule. In 1887 Cochinchina Annam Tonkin and the French Protectorate of Cambodia were grouped together to form French Indochina. The Nguy n dynasty remained the formal emperors of Annam and Tonkin within Indochina until World War II. Japan had occupied Indochina with French collaboration in 1940 but as the war seemed increasingly lost overthrew the French administration in March 1945 and proclaimed independence for its constituent countries. The Empire of Vietnam under Emperor B o i was a nominally independent Japanese puppet state during the last months of the war. It ended with B o i s abdication following the surrender of Japan and August Revolution by the anti colonial Vi t Minh in the August 1945. This ended the 143 year rule of the Nguy n dynasty.

{"id": "2223277", "abstract": ["Trespass to land is a common law tort or crime that is committed when an individual or the object of an individual intentionally or in Australia negligently enters the land of another without a lawful excuse. Trespass to land is actionable per se . Thus the party whose land is entered upon may sue even if no actual harm is done. In some jurisdictions this rule may also apply to entry upon public land having restricted access. A court may order payment of damages or an injunction to remedy the tort. By law trespass for mesne profits is a suit against someone who has been ejected from property that did not belong to them. The suit is for recovery of damages the trespasser caused to the property and for any profits he or she may have made while in possession of that property. For a trespass to be actionable the tortfeasor must voluntarily go to a specific location but need not be aware that he entered the property of a particular person. If A forces B unwillingly onto C s land C will not have action in trespass against B because B s actions were involuntary. C may instead claim against A. Furthermore if B is deceived by A as to the ownership or boundaries of C s land A may be jointly liable with B for B s trespass. In most jurisdictions if a person were to accidentally enter onto private property there would be no trespass because the person did not intend any violation. However in Australia negligence may substitute the requirement for intent. If a trespass is actionable and no action is taken within reasonable or prescribed time limits the land owner may forever lose the right to seek a remedy and may even forfeit certain property rights. See Adverse possession and Easement by prescription. Trespass may also arise upon the easement of one person upon the land of another. For example if A grants B a right to pass freely across A s land then A would trespass upon B s easement by erecting a locked gate or otherwise blocking B s rightful access. In some jurisdictions trespass while in possession of a firearm which may include a low power air weapon without ammunition constitutes a more grave crime of armed trespass. The maxim cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad infernos whoever owns the land owns it all the way to heaven and to hell is said to apply however that has been limited by practical considerations. For example aerial trespass is limited to airspace which might be used therefore aeroplanes cannot be sued . Landowners may not put up structures to prevent this. The courts have been more lenient with putting up structures to prevent underground trespass. The Kentucky Court of Appeal in Edwards v Sims 1929 24 SW 2d 619 seems to affirm the maxim without qualification whereas the New South Wales Supreme Court in Australia seemed more reluctant to do so in Di Napoli v New Beach Apartments 2004 Aust Torts Reports 81 728. There is therefore an asymmetry between aerial and underground trespass which may be resolved by the fact the ground is almost always used to support buildings and other structures whereas airspace loses its practical use above the height of skyscrapers. There may be regulations that hold a trespasser to a higher duty of care such as strict liability for timber trespass removing trees beyond a permitted boundary which is a type of trespass to chattels as a result of a trespass to land. Some cases also provide remedies for trespass not amounting to personal presence as where an object is intentionally deposited or farm animals are permitted to wander upon the land of another. Furthermore if a new use of nearby land interferes with a land owner s quiet enjoyment of his rights there may be an action for nuisance as where a disagreeable aroma or noise from A drifts across the land of B. Trespass ab initio is when a person is granted access to land but then abuses that access. The entry to the land is considered to have been a trespass from the beginning. This only applies to access given by law not to access given by a person as established by the Six Carpenters Case ."], "label": ["Society and social sciences", "Politic and economic", "Law"], "title": "Trespass to land", "headers": ["Ireland", "United Kingdom", "United States", "See also", "References"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["5254", "39343", "5785", "1090256", "8134", "201124", "4689264", "29813", "20583", "11388236", "153149", "1363846", "215415", "11293", "21436"]}

{"id": "23002", "abstract": ["In economics specifically general equilibrium theory a perfect market also known as an atomistic market is defined by several idealizing conditions collectively called perfect competition or atomistic competition . In theoretical models where conditions of perfect competition hold it has been demonstrated that a market will reach an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied for every product or service including labor equals the quantity demanded at the current price. This equilibrium would be a Pareto optimum. Perfect competition provides both allocative efficiency and productive efficiency Such markets are allocatively efficient as output will always occur where marginal cost is equal to average revenue i.e. price MC AR . In perfect competition any profit maximizing producer faces a market price equal to its marginal cost P MC . This implies that a factor s price equals the factor s marginal revenue product. It allows for derivation of the supply curve on which the neoclassical approach is based. This is also the reason why a monopoly does not have a supply curve. The abandonment of price taking creates considerable difficulties for the demonstration of a general equilibrium except under other very specific conditions such as that of monopolistic competition. In the short run perfectly competitive markets are not necessarily productively efficient as output will not always occur where marginal cost is equal to average cost MC AC . However in the long run productive efficiency occurs as new firms enter the industry. Competition reduces price and cost to the minimum of the long run average costs. At this point price equals both the marginal cost and the average total cost for each good P MC AC . The theory of perfect competition has its roots in late 19th century economic thought. L\u00e9on Walras gave the first rigorous definition of perfect competition and derived some of its main results. In the 1950s the theory was further formalized by Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu. Real markets are never perfect. Those economists who believe in perfect competition as a useful approximation to real markets may classify those as ranging from close to perfect to very imperfect. The real estate market is an example of a very imperfect market. In such markets the theory of the second best proves that if one optimality condition in an economic model cannot be satisfied it is possible that the next best solution involves changing other variables away from the values that would otherwise be optimal."], "label": ["Society and social sciences", "Politic and economic", "Business and economics"], "title": "Perfect competition", "headers": ["Idealizing conditions of perfect competition", "Normal profit", "Results", "Shutdown point", "Short-run supply curve", "Criticisms", "Equilibrium in perfect competition", "See also", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["9223", "160227", "3736784", "10517", "11231", "162807", "474724", "478097", "49894", "37973", "175864", "321438", "666256", "18819", "18878", "29664", "800930", "3284517", "1689345", "12102"]}

{"id": "232495", "abstract": ["Motivation is what explains why people or animals initiate continue or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. Motivational states are commonly understood as forces acting within the agent that create a disposition to engage in goal directed behavior. It is often held that different mental states compete with each other and that only the strongest state determines behavior. This means that we can be motivated to do something without actually doing it. The paradigmatic mental state providing motivation is desire. But various other states such as beliefs about what one ought to do or intentions may also provide motivation. Various competing theories have been proposed concerning the content of motivational states. They are known as content theories and aim to describe what goals usually or always motivate people. Abraham Maslow s hierarchy of needs and the ERG theory for example posit that humans have certain needs which are responsible for motivation. Some of these needs like for food and water are more basic than other needs such as for respect from others. On this view the higher needs can only provide motivation once the lower needs have been fulfilled. Behaviorist theories try to explain behavior solely in terms of the relation between the situation and external observable behavior without explicit reference to conscious mental states. Motivation may be either intrinsic if the activity is desired because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable or extrinsic if the agent s goal is an external reward distinct from the activity itself. It has been argued that intrinsic motivation has more beneficial outcomes than extrinsic motivation. Motivational states can also be categorized according to whether the agent is fully aware of why he acts the way he does or not referred to as conscious and unconscious motivation. Motivation is closely related to practical rationality. A central idea in this field is that we should be motivated to perform an action if we believe that we should perform it. Failing to fulfill this requirement results in cases of irrationality known as akrasia or weakness of the will in which there is a discrepancy between our beliefs about what we should do and our actions. Research on motivation has been employed in various fields. In the field of business a central question concerns work motivation for example what measures an employer can use to ensure that his employees are motivated. Motivation is also of particular interest to educational psychologists because of its crucial role in student learning. Specific interest has been given to the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in this field."], "label": ["Society and social sciences", "Social studies", "Psychology"], "title": "Motivation", "headers": ["Definition", "Motivation and mental states", "Content theories", "Types of motivation", "Neuroscience", "Motivational reasons and rationality", "Practical applications", "See also", "References", "Further reading"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["27158894", "301882", "41684", "17157119", "188540", "519280", "23597", "102883", "80381", "150497", "149422", "27834", "566664", "389401", "204995", "511394", "106238", "245632", "61032", "1976138", "355254", "252712", "42037", "26266653", "324180", "26743", "22649", "8983183", "9302", "18116330", "89842", "51970", "2402376", "649939", "17547", "18723138", "42434747", "2504", "1891445", "3007285", "48548"]}

{"id": "23575", "abstract": ["Parmenides of Elea was a pre Socratic Greek philosopher from Elea in Magna Graecia. He is thought to have been in his prime or floruit around 475 BC. Parmenides has been considered the founder of ontology or metaphysics and has influenced the whole history of Western philosophy. He was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy which also included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. Zeno s paradoxes of motion were to defend Parmenides view. The single known work by Parmenides is a poem whose original title is unknown but which is often referred to as On Nature. Only fragments of it survive but its importance lies in the fact that it contains the first sustained argument in the history of Western philosophy. In his poem Parmenides prescribes two views of reality. In the way of truth a part of the poem he explains how all reality is one change is impossible and existence is timeless uniform and necessary. In the way of opinion Parmenides explains the world of appearances in which one s sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful yet he does offer a cosmology. Parmenides philosophy has been explained with the slogan whatever is is and what is not cannot be . He is also credited with the phrase out of nothing nothing comes. He argues that A is not can never be thought or said truthfully and thus despite appearances everything exists as one giant unchanging thing. This is generally considered one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of being and has been contrasted with Heraclitus s statement that No man ever steps into the same river twice as one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of becoming. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus or Heraclitus to Parmenides. Parmenides views have remained relevant in philosophy even thousands of years after his death. Alexius Meinong much like Parmenides defended the view that even the golden mountain is real since it can be talked about. The rivalry between Heraclitus and Parmenides has also been re introduced in debates in the philosophy of time between A theory and B theory."], "label": ["People", "Philosophers, historians, political and social scientists", "Philosophers"], "title": "Parmenides", "headers": ["Biography", "On Nature", "Interpretations", "Legacy", "In culture", "See also", "Notes", "References", "Bibliography and further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["145040", "166200", "24086", "30340", "34535", "223339", "36817859", "38422", "43854", "143331", "23276", "37304", "233636", "25140", "7342", "170594", "3409", "13633", "19331", "22926", "19325", "10172", "10671", "2589714", "148363", "52813", "1216", "1737", "3408", "37080", "25664190", "45333", "308", "18895", "21830", "18836", "22954", "22261", "2844", "32408", "3206582", "16623", "140651", "20580", "78402", "13018310", "8211", "2590334", "13692155", "319762", "45748", "4163", "195193", "166162", "9942", "9302", "67088", "13704154", "26751", "13792", "217472", "1692795", "192007", "9553", "44525", "1864889", "13574", "736"]}

The term black church can also refer to individual congregations. While most black congregations belong to predominantly African American Protestant denominations such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church AME or Church of God in Christ COGIC many others are in predominantly white Protestant denominations such as the United Church of Christ which developed from the Congregational Church of New England or in integrated denominations such as the Church of God. There are also many Black Catholic churches. Most of the first black congregations and churches formed before 1800 were founded by freed blacks for example in Philadelphia Pennsylvania Springfield Baptist Church Augusta Georgia Petersburg Virginia and Savannah Georgia. The oldest black Baptist church in Kentucky and third oldest in the United States was founded about 1790 by the slave Peter Durrett. The oldest black Catholic church St Augustine in New Orleans was founded by free blacks in 1841. After slavery in the United States was abolished segregationist attitudes towards blacks and whites worshiping together were not as predominant in the North as compared to the South. Many white Protestant ministers moved to the South after the Civil War to establish churches where black and white people worshiped together. In Wesleyan Holiness denominations such as the Church of God the belief that interracial worship was a sign of the true Church was taught with both whites and blacks ministering regularly in Church of God congregations which invited people of all races to worship there. In some parts of the country such as New Orleans black and white Catholics had worshiped together for almost 150 years before the Civil War albeit without full equality and primarily under French and Spanish rule. Attacks by the Ku Klux Klan or other whites opposed to such efforts thwarted those attempts and even prevented Blacks from worshiping in the same buildings as whites. In communities where black and white people worshiped together in the South shortly after the Civil War the persecution of African Americans was less severe. Yet freed blacks most often established congregations and church facilities separate from their white neighbors who were often their former owners. In the Catholic Church the rising tide of segregation eventually resulted in segregated parishes across the South even in places where segregation had not previously been the norm. These new black churches created communities and worship practices that were culturally distinct from other churches including forms of Christian worship that derived from African spiritual traditions such as call and response. These churches also became the centers of communities serving as school sites taking up social welfare functions such as providing for the indigent and going on to establish orphanages and prison ministries.

Therapies include herbal medicines special diets meditation yoga massage laxatives enemas and medical oils. Ayurvedic preparations are typically based on complex herbal compounds minerals and metal substances perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or rasashastra . Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques including rhinoplasty kidney stone extractions sutures and the extraction of foreign objects. The main classical Ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the gods to sages and then to human physicians. In Sushruta Samhita Sushruta s Compendium Sushruta wrote that Dhanvantari Hindu god of Ayurveda incarnated himself as a king of Varanasi and taught medicine to a group of physicians including Sushruta. Ayurveda has been adapted for Western consumption notably by Baba Hari Dass in the 1970s and Maharishi Ayurveda in the 1980s. Some scholars assert that Ayurveda originated in prehistoric times. Ayurveda developed significantly during the Vedic period and later some of the non Vedic systems such as Buddhism and Jainism also developed medical concepts and practices that appear in the classical Ayurveda texts.

{"id": "23688", "abstract": ["Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth whether spoken or in writing concerning matters material to an official proceeding. Like most other crimes in the common law system to be convicted of perjury one must have had the intention mens rea to commit the act and to have actually committed the act actus reus . Further statements that are facts cannot be considered perjury even if they might arguably constitute an omission and it is not perjury to lie about matters that are immaterial to the legal proceeding. Statements that entail an interpretation of fact are not perjury because people often draw inaccurate conclusions unwittingly or make honest mistakes without the intent to deceive. Individuals may have honest but mistaken beliefs about certain facts or their recollection may be inaccurate or may have a different perception of what is the accurate way to state the truth. In some jurisdictions no crime has occurred when a false statement is intentionally or unintentionally made while under oath or subject to penalty. Instead criminal culpability attaches only at the instant the declarant falsely asserts the truth of statements made or to be made that are material to the outcome of the proceeding. For example it is not perjury to lie about one s age except if age is a fact material to influencing the legal result such as eligibility for old age retirement benefits or whether a person was of an age to have legal capacity. Perjury is considered a serious offense as it can be used to usurp the power of the courts resulting in miscarriages of justice. In Canada those who commits perjury are guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years. Perjury is a statutory offence in England and Wales. A person convicted of perjury is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or to a fine or to both. In the United States the general perjury statute under federal law classifies perjury as a felony and provides for a prison sentence of up to five years. The California Penal Code allows for perjury to be a capital offense in cases causing wrongful execution. Perjury which caused the wrongful execution of another or in the pursuit of causing the wrongful execution of another is respectively construed as murder or attempted murder and is normally itself punishable by execution in countries that retain the death penalty. Perjury is considered a felony in most U.S. states as well as most Australian states. In Queensland under Section 124 of the Queensland Criminal Code Act 1899 perjury is punishable by up to life in prison if it is committed to procure an innocent person for a crime that is punishable by life in prison. However prosecutions for perjury are rare. In some countries such as France and Italy suspects cannot be heard under oath or affirmation and so cannot commit perjury regardless of what they say during their trial. The rules for perjury also apply when a person has made a statement under penalty of perjury even if the person has not been sworn or affirmed as a witness before an appropriate official. An example is the US income tax return which by law must be signed as true and correct under penalty of perjury see . Federal tax law provides criminal penalties of up to three years in prison for violation of the tax return perjury statute.

Berzelius is considered along with Robert Boyle John Dalton and Antoine Lavoisier to be one of the founders of modern chemistry. Berzelius became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1808 and served from 1818 as its principal functionary. He is known in Sweden as the Father of Swedish Chemistry . Berzelius Day is celebrated on 20 August in honour of him. Although Berzelius began his career as a physician his enduring contributions were in the fields of electrochemistry chemical bonding and stoichiometry. In particular he is noted for his determination of atomic weights and his experiments that led to a more complete understanding of the principles of stoichiometry which is the branch of chemistry pertaining to the quantitative relationships between elements in chemical compounds and chemical reactions and that these occur in definite proportions. This understanding came to be known as the Law of Constant Proportions . Berzelius was a strict empiricist expecting that any new theory must be consistent with the sum of contemporary chemical knowledge. He developed improved methods of chemical analysis which were required to develop the basic data in support of his work on stoichiometry. He investigated isomerism allotropy and catalysis phenomena that owe their names to him. Berzelius was among the first to articulate the differences between inorganic compounds and organic compounds. Among the many minerals and elements he studied he is credited with discovering cerium and selenium and with being the first to isolate silicon and thorium. Following on his interest in mineralogy Berzelius synthesized and chemically characterized new compounds of these and other elements. Berzelius demonstrated the use of an electrochemical cell to decompose certain chemical compounds into pairs of electrically opposite constituents. From this research he articulated a theory that came to be known as electrochemical dualism contending that chemical compounds are oxide salts bonded together by electrostatic interactions. This theory while useful in some contexts came to be seen as insufficient. Berzelius s work with atomic weights and his theory of electrochemical dualism led to his development of a modern system of chemical formula notation that showed the composition of any compound both qualitatively and quantitatively. His system abbreviated the Latin names of the elements with one or two letters and applied superscripts to designate the number of atoms of each element present in the compound. Later chemists changed to use of subscripts rather than superscripts."], "label": ["People", "Scientists, inventors, and mathematicians", "Chemistry"], "title": "J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius", "headers": ["Biography", "Achievements", "Works", "Relations with other scientists", "Honors and recognition", "See also", "References", "Further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["840273", "19883", "27117", "5180", "29969", "19583", "23634", "28650", "26094", "132197", "10174", "2265662", "23001", "63847", "9601", "30048", "27114", "10065", "10339", "7787", "10777", "12950", "2844", "19555", "17561", "1367595", "157164", "34273", "25086027", "30044", "17744", "31734", "3524766", "1923", "19356", "1839", "50237", "20648024", "172474", "31801", "34422", "24580596", "23315", "5914", "26741", "5659", "1822", "558685", "7043", "51624", "14734", "22303", "216908", "44112", "11861", "33971", "30463", "16142", "604727", "32431", "55584", "59483", "5058739", "14369"]}

A patrician of illustrious lineage Caecus first came to prominence with his election to the position of censor in 312 BC which he held for five years. During Caecus s time in office aside from his building projects he introduced several controversial but poorly understood constitutional reforms he increased the voting power of the poor and landless in the legislative assemblies and admitted lower class citizens to the Roman Senate though these measures were partially undone by the resentful nobility. In addition Caecus was the first censor to draw up a formal list of senators. These reforms massively increased the prestige of the censorship which had previously only been a minor magistracy. As consul 296 BC and then praetor 295 BC Caecus led military campaigns against the Etruscans and Samnites. Later in life having become blind whence the surname from old age he delivered a speech to the Senate successfully opposing peace with the Epirote king Pyrrhus. His reforms did trigger some outrage as he broke a number of established traditions. Appius embroiled himself in several bitter political feuds especially with the Fabii a powerful Roman family . Fabius Pictor who was the earliest Roman historian and a member of the Fabian family may have been the source for a significant amount of smear against Caecus accusing him of being a corrupted immoral demagogue and an inept general. Owing to the wide divergence in the sources modern scholars have had very different interpretations of Caecus deeds he has been described as a revolutionary a reactionary a would be tyrant or a great reformer comparable to Athenian figures like Clisthenes and Pericles."], "label": ["People", "Politicians and leaders", "Ancient"], "title": "Appius Claudius Caecus", "headers": ["Family background", "Early career", "Censorship (312\u2013308 BC)", "Legal Contributions", "Later career (307\u2013280 BC)", "Notable quotes", "Descendants", "Family tree of Appius Caecus", "References", "Bibliography"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["25816", "449566", "92894", "44943", "22209", "36812", "229765", "6046", "25458", "18963870", "32408", "25447", "197745", "18049"]}

In other words each cell is individually tuned to respond in a certain way based on the desired output of the NIM. The aggregate response is mainly determined by each unit cell s geometry and substantially differs from the response of its constituent materials. In other words the way the NIM responds is that of a new material unlike the wires or metals and dielectrics it is made from. Hence the NIM has become an effective medium.

The primary belligerents were the Valois kings of France and their Habsburg opponents in Spain and the Holy Roman Empire supported at different times by Milan Venice and other Italian city states. They ended with the 1559 Peace of Cateau Cambr\u00e9sis which established the Habsburgs as the leading power in Italy. The 1454 Italic League achieved a balance of power in Italy and resulted in a period of rapid economic growth which ended with the death of Lorenzo de Medici in 1492. Combined with the ambition of Ludovico Sforza its collapse allowed Charles VIII of France to invade Naples in 1494 which drew in Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. Despite being forced to withdraw in 1495 Charles showed the Italian states were both wealthy and vulnerable due to their political divisions. Italy became a battleground in the struggle for European domination between France and the Habsburgs with the conflict expanding into Flanders the Rhineland and the Mediterranean Sea. Other external powers were involved for short periods notably England and the Ottoman Empire. Fought with considerable brutality the wars took place against the background of religious turmoil caused by the Reformation particularly in France and the Holy Roman Empire. They are seen as a turning point in the evolution from medieval to modern warfare with the use of the Arquebus or handgun becoming common along with significant technological improvements in siege artillery. Literate commanders and modern printing methods also make them one of the first conflicts with a significant number of contemporary accounts including Francesco Guicciardini Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Blaise de Montluc. After 1503 most of the fighting was initiated by French invasions of Lombardy and Piedmont but although able to hold territory for periods of time they could not do so permanently. By 1557 both France and the Empire were confronted by internal divisions over religion while Spain faced a potential revolt in the Spanish Netherlands.

{"id": "239836", "abstract": ["In chemistry aromaticity is a property of cyclic ring shaped typically planar flat molecular structures with pi bonds in resonance those containing delocalized electrons that gives increased stability compared with other geometric or connective arrangements with the same set of atoms. Aromatic rings are very stable and do not break apart easily. Organic compounds that are not aromatic are classified as aliphatic compounds they might be cyclic but only aromatic rings have enhanced stability. Since the most common aromatic compounds are derivatives of benzene an aromatic hydrocarbon common in petroleum and its distillates the word aromatic occasionally refers informally to benzene derivatives and so it was first defined. Nevertheless many non benzene aromatic compounds exist. In living organisms for example the most common aromatic rings are the double ringed bases in RNA and DNA. An aromatic functional group or other substituent is called an aryl group. The earliest use of the term aromatic was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. Hofmann used the term for a class of benzene compounds many of which have odors aromas unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons. Aromaticity as a chemical property bears no general relationship with the olfactory properties of such compounds how they smell although in 1855 before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants such as terpenes had chemical properties that we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene. In terms of the electronic nature of the molecule aromaticity describes a conjugated system often made of alternating single and double bonds in a ring. This configuration allows for the electrons in the molecule s pi system to be delocalized around the ring increasing the molecule s stability. The molecule cannot be represented by one structure but rather a resonance hybrid of different structures such as with the two resonance structures of benzene. These molecules cannot be found in either one of these representations with the longer single bonds in one location and the shorter double bond in another see Theory below . Rather the molecule exhibits bond lengths in between those of single and double bonds. This commonly seen model of aromatic rings namely the idea that benzene was formed from a six membered carbon ring with alternating single and double bonds cyclohexatriene was developed by August Kekul\u00e9 see History below . The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms which corresponds to the double and single bonds superimposing to produce six one and a half bonds.

Because of their dependence on the sea ice polar bears are classified as marine mammals. Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species. For decades large scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect. For thousands of years the polar bear has been a key figure in the material spiritual and cultural life of circumpolar peoples and polar bears remain important in their cultures. Historically the polar bear has also been known as the white bear .

The game is played by two opposing teams with the objective of scoring using a long handled wooden mallet to hit a small hard ball through the opposing team s goal. Each team has four mounted riders and the game usually lasts one to two hours divided into periods called chukkas or chukkers . Polo has been called the sport of kings and has become a spectator sport for equestrians and high society often supported by sponsorship. The concept of the game and its variants date back from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD originated from equestrian games played by nomadic Iranian and Turkic peoples. The sport was at first a training game for Persian cavalry units usually the royal guard or other elite troops. A notable example is Saladin who was known for being a skilled polo player which contributed to his cavalry training. It is now popular around the world with well over 100 member countries in the Federation of International Polo played professionally in 16 countries and was an Olympic sport from 1900 to 1936. Arena polo is an indoor semi outdoor variant with similar rules and is played with three riders per team. The playing field is smaller enclosed and usually of compacted sand or fine aggregate and often indoors.

The family contains a single genus Hemiprocne with four species. They are distributed from India and Southeast Asia through Indonesia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Treeswifts are small to medium sized swifts ranging in length from 15 to 30 cm. They have long wings with most of the length coming from the length of the primaries their arms are actually quite short. They visibly differ from the other swifts in matters of plumage which is softer and they have crests or other facial ornaments and long forked tails. Anatomically they are separated from the true swifts by skeletal details in the cranium and palate the anatomy of the tarsus and a nonreversible hind toe that is used for perching on branches an activity in which true swifts are unable to engage . The males have iridescent mantle plumage. They also have diastataxic wings that is they lack a fifth secondary feather unlike swifts in the Apodini which are eutaxic. The treeswifts exhibit a wide range of habitat preferences. One species the whiskered treeswift is a species belonging to primary forest. Highly manoeuvrable it feeds close to vegetation beneath the canopy and only rarely ventures into secondary forests or plantations but never over open ground. Other species are less restricted the crested treeswift makes use of a range of habitats including humid forests and deciduous woodland and the grey rumped treeswift occupies almost every habitat type available from the mangrove forests to hill forests. All species feed on insects although exact details of what prey are taken has not been studied in detail. Nest building responsibilities are shared by the male and female. They lay one egg in the nest which is glued to an open tree branch. Egg colour varies from white to grey.

{"id": "250959", "abstract": ["The Laramide orogeny was a time period of mountain building in western North America which started in the Late Cretaceous 70 to 80 million years ago and ended 35 to 55 million years ago. The exact duration and ages of beginning and end of the orogeny are in dispute. The Laramide orogeny occurred in a series of pulses with quiescent phases intervening. The major feature that was created by this orogeny was deep seated thick skinned deformation with evidence of this orogeny found from Canada to northern Mexico with the easternmost extent of the mountain building represented by the Black Hills of South Dakota. The phenomenon is named for the Laramie Mountains of eastern Wyoming. The Laramide orogeny is sometimes confused with the Sevier orogeny which partially overlapped in time and space. The orogeny is commonly attributed to events off the west coast of North America where the Kula and Farallon Plates were sliding under the North American plate. Most hypotheses propose that oceanic crust was undergoing flat slab subduction i.e. with a shallow subduction angle and as a consequence no magmatism occurred in the central west of the continent and the underlying oceanic lithosphere actually caused drag on the root of the overlying continental lithosphere. One cause for shallow subduction may have been an increased rate of plate convergence. Another proposed cause was subduction of thickened oceanic crust. Magmatism associated with subduction occurred not near the plate edges as in the volcanic arc of the Andes for example but far to the east called the Coast Range Arc. Geologists call such a lack of volcanic activity near a subduction zone a magmatic gap. This particular gap may have occurred because the subducted slab was in contact with relatively cool continental lithosphere not hotter asthenosphere. One result of shallow angle of subduction and the drag that it caused was a broad belt of mountains some of which were the progenitors of the Rocky Mountains. Part of the proto Rocky Mountains would be later modified by extension to become the Basin and Range Province."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Earth science", "Earth"], "title": "Laramide orogeny", "headers": ["Basins and mountains", "Ecological consequences", "See also", "Footnotes", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["145716", "9419", "4546155", "19978", "25459", "5816", "23234", "33611", "145813", "44412", "1102339", "246010", "5615", "21139", "23580", "5399", "145717", "53879", "5042916", "22286", "26746", "23291", "3966054", "23645", "494305", "70117", "19594534", "31716", "19322", "23310", "54410", "86359", "18953024", "1354", "254443", "72726"]}

It is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh least populous with slightly fewer than 1.1 million residents as of 2020 but it is the second most densely populated after New Jersey. It takes its name from the eponymous island though most of its land area is on the mainland. Rhode Island borders Connecticut to the west Massachusetts to the north and east and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound it also shares a small maritime border with New York. Providence is its capital and most populous city. Native Americans lived around Narragansett Bay for thousands of years before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century. Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies for being founded by a refugee Roger Williams who fled religious persecution from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty. He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts earning it the moniker Rogue s Island . Reflecting its status as a hub of relative tolerance and free thought Rhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress in 1774 and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4 1776. After the American Revolution during which it was heavily occupied and contested Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 9 1778.

A Republican for most of his life he ran for president of the United States as the nominee of his own Progressive Party in the 1924 presidential election. Historian John D. Buenker describes La Follette as the most celebrated figure in Wisconsin history . Born and raised in Wisconsin La Follette won election as the Dane County District Attorney in 1880. Four years later he was elected to the House of Representatives where he was friendly with party leaders like William McKinley. After losing his seat in the 1890 election La Follette embraced progressivism and built up a coalition of disaffected Republicans. He sought election as governor in 1896 and 1898 before winning the 1900 gubernatorial election. As governor of Wisconsin La Follette compiled a progressive record implementing primary elections and tax reform. La Follette won re election in 1902 and 1904 but in 1905 the legislature elected him to the United States Senate. He emerged as a national progressive leader in the Senate often clashing with conservatives like Nelson Aldrich. He initially supported President William Howard Taft but broke with Taft after the latter failed to push a reduction in tariff rates. He challenged Taft for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1912 presidential election but his candidacy was overshadowed by that of former President Theodore Roosevelt. La Follette s refusal to support Roosevelt alienated many progressives and though La Follette continued to serve in the Senate he lost his stature as the leader of that chamber s progressive Republicans. La Follette supported some of President Woodrow Wilson s policies but he broke with the president over foreign policy. During World War I La Follette was one of the most outspoken opponents of the administration s domestic and international policies. With the Republican and Democratic Parties each nominating conservative candidates in the 1924 presidential election left wing groups coalesced behind La Follette s third party candidacy. With the support of the Socialist Party farmer s groups labor unions and others La Follette briefly appeared to be a serious threat to unseat Republican President Calvin Coolidge. La Follette stated that his chief goal was to break the combined power of the private monopoly system over the political and economic life of the American people and he called for government ownership of railroads and electric utilities cheap credit for farmers the outlawing of child labor stronger laws to help labor unions and protections for civil liberties. His diverse coalition proved challenging to manage and the Republicans rallied to claim victory in the 1924 election. La Follette won 16.6 of the popular vote one of the best third party performances in U.S. history. He died shortly after the presidential election but his sons Robert M.

{"id": "25604", "abstract": ["Radon is a chemical element with the symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive colorless odorless tasteless noble gas. It occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into lead and various other short lived radioactive elements. Radon itself is the immediate decay product of radium. Its most stable isotope 222Rn has a half life of only 3.8 days making it one of the rarest elements. Since thorium and uranium are two of the most common radioactive elements on Earth while also having three isotopes with half lives on the order of several billion years radon will be present on Earth long into the future despite its short half life. The decay of radon produces many other short lived nuclides known as radon daughters ending at stable isotopes of lead. Unlike all other intermediate elements in the aforementioned decay chains radon is under standard conditions gaseous and easily inhaled and therefore a health hazard. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual s background radiation dose but due to local differences in geology the level of exposure to radon gas differs from place to place. A common source is uranium containing minerals in the ground and therefore it accumulates in subterranean areas such as basements. Radon can also occur in some ground water like spring waters and hot springs. Epidemiological studies have shown a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer. Radon is a contaminant that affects indoor air quality worldwide. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking causing 21 000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. About 2 900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked. While radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer it is the number one cause among non smokers according to EPA policy oriented estimates. Significant uncertainties exist for the health effects of low dose exposures.

{"id": "25614", "abstract": ["A race is a categorization of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into groups generally viewed as distinct within a given society. The term was first used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations. By the 17th century the term began to refer to physical phenotypical traits. Modern science regards race as a social construct an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society. While partly based on physical similarities within groups race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning. Social conceptions and groupings of races have varied over time often involving folk taxonomies that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. Today scientists consider such biological essentialism obsolete and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits. Even though there is a broad scientific agreement that essentialist and typological conceptions of race are untenable scientists around the world continue to conceptualize race in widely differing ways. While some researchers continue to use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits or observable differences in behavior others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race is inherently naive or simplistic. Still others argue that among humans race has no taxonomic significance because all living humans belong to the same subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens . Since the second half of the 20th century the association of race with the discredited theories of scientific racism has contributed to race becoming increasingly seen as a largely pseudoscientific system of classification.

{"id": "257241", "abstract": ["Antonio Toni Negri born 1 August 1933 is an Italian Spinozistic Marxist sociologist and political philosopher best known for his co authorship of Empire and secondarily for his work on Spinoza. Born in Padua he became a political philosophy professor in his hometown university. Negri founded the Potere Operaio Worker Power group in 1969 and was a leading member of Autonomia Operaia . As one of the most popular theorists of Autonomism he has published hugely influential books urging revolutionary consciousness. He was accused in the late 1970s of various charges including being the mastermind of the left wing terrorist organization Red Brigades Brigate Rosse or BR involved in the May 1978 kidnapping of Aldo Moro two time Prime Minister of Italy and leader of the Christian Democrat Party among others. He was wrongly suspected to have made a threatening phone call on behalf of the BR but the court was unable to conclusively prove his ties. Nevertheless he was convicted in 1984 and sentenced in absentia to 30 years in prison. He was given an additional four years on the charge of being morally responsible for the violence of political activists in the 1960s and 1970s. The question of Negri s complicity with left wing extremism is a controversial subject. He was indicted on a number of charges including association and insurrection against the state a charge which was later dropped and sentenced for involvement in two murders. Negri fled to France where protected by the Mitterrand doctrine he taught at the Paris VIII Vincennes and the Coll\u00e8ge international de philosophie along with Jacques Derrida Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. In 1997 after a plea bargain that reduced his prison time from 30 to 13 years he returned to Italy to serve the end of his sentence. Many of his most influential books were published while he was behind bars. He now lives in Venice and Paris with his partner the French philosopher Judith Revel. Like Deleuze Negri s preoccupation with Spinoza is well known in contemporary philosophy. Along with Althusser and Deleuze he has been one of the central figures of a French inspired in continental philosophy of the late 20th and early 21st centuries that was the second remarkable Spinoza revival in history after a well known rediscovery of Spinoza by German thinkers especially the German Romantics and Idealists in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Menda\u00f1a returned decades later in 1595 and another Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s visited the Solomons in 1606. Britain defined its area of interest in the Solomon Islands archipelago in June 1893 when Captain Gibson R.N. of declared the southern Solomon Islands a British protectorate.

{"id": "26764", "abstract": ["The International System of Units known by the international abbreviation SI in all languages and sometimes pleonastically as the SI system is the modern form of the metric system and the world s most widely used system of measurement. Established and maintained by the General Conference on Weights and Measures CGPM it is the only system of measurement with an official status in nearly every country in the world employed in science technology industry and everyday commerce. The SI comprises a coherent system of units of measurement starting with seven base units which are the second symbol s the unit of time metre m length kilogram kg mass ampere A electric current kelvin K thermodynamic temperature mole mol amount of substance and candela cd luminous intensity . The system can accommodate coherent units for an unlimited number of additional quantities. These are called coherent derived units which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units. Twenty two coherent derived units have been provided with special names and symbols. The seven base units and the 22 coherent derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other coherent derived units. Since the sizes of coherent units will be convenient for only some applications and not for others the SI provides twenty prefixes which when added to the name and symbol of a coherent unit produce twenty additional non coherent SI units for the same quantity these non coherent units are always decimal i.e. power of ten multiples and sub multiples of the coherent unit. The SI is intended to be an evolving system units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. Since 2019 the magnitudes of all SI units have been defined by declaring that seven defining constants have certain exact numerical values when expressed in terms of their SI units. These defining constants are the speed of light in vacuum the hyperfine transition frequency of caesium the Planck constant the elementary charge the Boltzmann constant the Avogadro constant and the luminous efficacy . The nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as to the purely technical constant . Prior to 2019 and were not defined a priori but were rather very precisely measured quantities. In 2019 their values were fixed by definition to their best estimates at the time ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units. The current way of defining the SI is a result of a decades long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the realisations of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions. A consequence is that as science and technologies develop new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the unit. One problem with artefacts is that they can be lost damaged or changed another is that they introduce uncertainties that cannot be reduced by advancements in science and technology. The last artefact used by the SI was the International Prototype of the Kilogram a cylinder of platinum iridium. The original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the centimetre gram second CGS systems specifically the inconsistency between the systems of electrostatic units and electromagnetic units and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The General Conference on Weights and Measures French CGPM which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875 brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948 so it is based on the metre kilogram second system of units MKS rather than any variant of the CGS."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Basics and measurement", "Measurement"], "title": "International System of Units", "headers": ["Introduction", "Controlling authority", "Units and prefixes", "Lexicographic conventions", "International System of Quantities", "Realisation of units", "Evolution of the SI", "History", "Metric units that are not recognised by the SI", "See also", "Notes", "References", "Further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["65929", "1163049", "191803", "32308", "14004", "9598", "23295", "312881", "20611356", "9804", "59438", "14752", "287152", "155869", "174945", "155835", "9891", "19555", "1101364", "17791", "56938", "21347693", "1890", "22209", "215754", "9532", "26873", "1196", "155829", "8578", "47139", "19147", "25739045", "772", "5639", "18542", "12882", "155823", "10779", "65637", "165146", "20647050", "7669", "24919513", "53933", "425290", "39208", "3716784", "773153", "23195", "19048", "629028", "20627", "33931", "18094", "305844", "202482", "14121", "19593167", "31109470", "16327", "935979", "640764", "9649", "39913055", "11448", "21837", "23205", "44365", "581888", "1294851", "72540", "8410", "94102", "194227", "41789", "426889", "11884", "41402", "2722", "14870", "19372", "28989696", "135316", "8429", "32498", "10597", "23783987", "42445", "53460", "108956", "25453345", "23316", "32502", "180090", "527046", "532592", "65890", "30012", "3363", "19159", "41545", "26288711", "742238", "19594213", "313418", "197767", "82354", "20353", "25658445", "225982", "19593121", "23523100", "67231", "33302", "30366", "8267", "759264", "9877", "8376", "18947", "59125", "714710", "12462", "146839", "556970", "524122", "32567", "37027825", "57307464", "65927", "11559418", "41957", "24236", "2443", "71469", "14878", "473326", "26003", "57357", "18306", "1195294", "1363657", "66014", "23619", "14934", "43427", "40283", "82355", "19457", "2431", "4739", "5188", "7346", "201629", "4068", "164570", "9734557", "56558", "48902", "1209", "362631", "902", "30125638", "265730", "9426", "23592200", "8331759", "80353", "25453985", "17140", "20431", "30400", "199829", "16619", "5498706", "6423", "15492", "1085308", "47719", "44142", "28299", "41625", "9476", "4562902", "33125", "1210", "18902", "55212", "31185", "23204", "37400", "19022", "6125", "6207", "664655", "2532789", "2983", "3543585", "53702", "246469", "4115", "23324", "113302", "81931", "10902", "1241988", "20491903", "37673", "9251", "7512", "2970774", "140711", "32549", "18524", "82961", "28736", "6136", "17327", "28748", "21289", "14996", "41092", "9531", "18963787", "47484", "754487", "23372", "49295", "50510", "496064", "19559", "65894", "27238", "5385", "1610231", "74366", "2770302"]}

The best known member of a musical family dynasty by the 1610s he was the leading composer and organist in England with a career cut short by his sudden death in 1625. As a result Gibbons s oeuvre was not as large as that of his contemporaries like the elder William Byrd but he made considerable contributions to many genres of his time. He is often seen as a transitional figure from the Renaissance to the Baroque periods. Gibbons was born into a musical family where his father was a wait his brothers Edward Ellis and Ferdinand were musicians and Orlando was expected to follow the tradition. It is not known under whom he studied although it may have been with Edward or Byrd but he almost certainly studied the keyboard in his youth. Irrespective of his education he was musically proficient enough to be appointed an unsalaried member of the Chapel Royal in May 1603 and a full fledged gentleman of the Chapel Royal as junior organist by 1605. By 1606 he had graduated from King s College Cambridge with a Bachelor of Music degree. Throughout his professional career Gibbons had increasingly good relations with many important people of the English court. King James I and Prince Charles were supportive patrons and others such as Sir Christopher Hatton even became close friends. Along with Byrd and John Bull Gibbons was the youngest contributor to the first printed collection of English keyboard music Parthenia and published other compositions in his lifetime notably the First Set of Madrigals and Motets 1612 which includes the best known English madrigal The Silver Swan . Other important compositions include This Is the Record of John the 8 part full anthem O Clap Your Hands Together and 2 settings of Evensong. The most important position achieved by Gibbons was his appointment in 1623 as the organist at Westminster Abbey which he held for 2 years until his death. Gibbons developed Byrd s foundations of the English madrigal full and verse anthems and by doing so he exerted significant influence on subsequent English composers. This generation included his oldest son Christopher who would teach John Blow Pelham Humfrey and Henry Purcell the English pioneer of the Baroque era. After his death he was primarily remembered a composer of sacred music. Since the early music revival however increased attention has come to his other compositions with his keyboard works championed by Glenn Gould while his madrigals and viol fantasies are popular among early music ensembles.

Located in the Leeward Islands chain of the Lesser Antilles it is the smallest sovereign state in the Western Hemisphere in both area and population as well as the world s smallest sovereign federation. The country is a Commonwealth realm with Elizabeth II as Queen and head of state. It is the only sovereign federation in the Caribbean. The capital city is Basseterre located on the larger island of Saint Kitts. Basseterre is also the main port for both passenger entry via cruise ships and cargo. The smaller island of Nevis lies approximately to the southeast of Saint Kitts across a shallow channel called The Narrows. The British dependency of Anguilla was historically also a part of this union which was then known collectively as Saint Christopher Nevis Anguilla. However Anguilla chose to secede from the union and remains a British overseas territory. To the north northwest lie the islands of Sint Eustatius Saba Saint Barth\u00e9lemy Saint Martin Sint Maarten and Anguilla. To the east and northeast are Antigua and Barbuda and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of Redonda part of Antigua and Barbuda and the island of Montserrat. Saint Kitts and Nevis were among the first islands in the Caribbean to be colonized by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first British and French colonies in the Caribbean and thus has also been titled The Mother Colony of the West Indies . It is also the most recent British territory in the Caribbean to become independent gaining independence in 1983. Etymology Saint Kitts was named which roughly translates as fertile land by the Kalinago who originally inhabited the island. It is thought that Christopher Columbus the first European to see the islands in 1493 named the larger island after Saint Christopher his patron saint and that of travellers. New studies suggest that Columbus named the island Saint James and that the name was in fact given by Columbus to the island now known as Saba northwest. No matter the origin of the name the island was well documented as by the 17th century. The first English colonists kept the English translation of this name and dubbed it St. Christopher s Island . In the 17th century a common nickname for Christopher was Kit t hence the island came to be informally referred to as Saint Kitt s Island later further shortened to Saint Kitts . Columbus gave Nevis the name . The current name Nevis is derived from a Spanish name meaning Our Lady of the Snows . It is not known who chose this name for the island but it is a reference to the story of a 4th century Catholic miracle a summertime snowfall on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. It is thought that the white clouds which usually wreathe the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate.

{"id": "27298083", "abstract": ["Neanderthals also Neandertals Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens neanderthalensis are an extinct species or subspecies of archaic humans who lived in Eurasia until about 40 000 years ago. While the cause of their extinction remains highly contested demographic factors like small population size inbreeding and random fluctuations are considered likely factors. Other scholars have proposed competitive replacement assimilation into the modern human genome bred into extinction great climatic change disease or a combination of these factors. It is unclear when the line of Neanderthals split from that of modern humans studies have produced various intervals ranging from 315 000 to more than 800 000 years ago. The time of divergence of Neanderthals from their ancestor H. heidelbergensis is also unclear. The oldest potential Neanderthal bones date to 430 000 years ago but the classification remains uncertain. Neanderthals are known from numerous fossils especially from after 130 000 years ago. The type specimen Neanderthal 1 was found in 1856 in the Neander Valley in present day Germany. For much of the early 20th Century researchers depicted Neanderthals as primitive unintelligent and brutish. Although knowledge and perception of them has markedly changed since then in the scientific community the image of the unevolved caveman archetype remains prevalent in popular culture. Neanderthal technology was quite sophisticated. It includes the Mousterian stone tool industry and the ability to create fire and build cave hearths make the adhesive birch bark tar craft at least simple clothes similar to blankets and ponchos weave go seafaring through the Mediterranean make use of medicinal plants as well as treat severe injuries store food and use various cooking techniques such as roasting boiling and smoking. Neanderthals made use of a wide array of food mainly hoofed mammals but also other megafauna plants small mammals birds and aquatic and marine resources. Although they were probably apex predators they still competed with cave bears cave lions cave hyaenas and other large predators. A number of examples of symbolic thought and Palaeolithic art have been inconclusively attributed to Neanderthals namely possible ornaments made from bird claws and feathers or shells collections of unusual objects including crystals and fossils engravings music production indicated by the Divje Babe Flute and Spanish cave paintings contentiously dated to before 65 000 years ago. Some claims of religious beliefs have been made. Neanderthals were likely capable of speech possibly articulate although the complexity of their language is not known. Compared with modern humans Neanderthals had a more robust build and proportionally shorter limbs. Researchers often explain these features as adaptations to conserve heat in a cold climate but they may also have been adaptations for sprinting in the warmer forested landscape that Neanderthals often inhabited. Nonetheless they had cold specific adaptations such as specialised body fat storage and an enlarged nose to warm air although the nose could have been caused by genetic drift . Average Neanderthal men stood around and women tall similar to pre industrial modern humans. The braincases of Neanderthal men and women averaged about and respectively which is within the range of the values for modern humans. The Neanderthal skull was more elongated and had smaller parietal lobes and cerebellum morphological traits used to assign specimens to species. The total population of Neanderthals remained low proliferating weakly harmful gene variants and precluding effective long distance networks. Despite this there is evidence of regional cultures and thus of regular communication between communities. They may have frequented caves and moved between them seasonally. Neanderthals lived in a high stress environment with high trauma rates and about 80 died before the age of 40. The 2010 Neanderthal genome project s draft report presented evidence for interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans. It possibly occurred 316 219 000 years ago but more likely 100 000 years ago and again 65 000 years ago. Neanderthals also appear to have interbred with Denisovans a different group of archaic humans in Siberia. Around 1 4 of genomes of Eurasians Australo Melanesians Native Americans and North Africans is of Neanderthal ancestry while the inhabitants of sub Saharan Africa have no detectable Neanderthal ancestry save possible traces from early Sapiens to Neanderthal gene flow and or more recent back migration of Eurasians to Africa. In all about 20 of distinctly Neanderthal gene variants survive today. Although many of the gene variants inherited from Neanderthals may have been detrimental and selected out Neanderthal introgression appears to have affected the modern human immune system and is also implicated in several other biological functions and structures but a large portion appears to be non coding DNA."], "label": ["Biological and health sciences", "Biology", "Evolutionary biology"], "title": "Neanderthal", "headers": ["Taxonomy", "Evolution", "Demographics", "Anatomy", "Culture", "Interbreeding", "Extinction", "In popular culture", "See also", "Explanatory notes", "Citations", "General bibliography", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["47544", "184854", "1108628", "34255537", "262601", "320509", "52255", "12437", "212191", "30843", "20423", "414350", "4402", "28181", "2494", "1805", "146072", "52636", "6058", "472212", "26569537", "19554533", "1661334", "32528", "23048", "14207", "274788", "49611", "82804", "185901", "309759", "39696", "3222831", "39282", "69605", "5482408", "22721", "21780446", "221839", "442638", "26860", "26787", "422569", "14821485", "29932", "52993", "779725", "42563", "6700", "21505", "504841", "44284", "20611107", "11884", "9668", "33112993", "2992", "44593", "210294", "4788", "4292", "14579", "380781", "17748", "227807", "14958", "31744", "700610", "32152", "34126", "1164051", "33607453", "2165266", "72016", "188494", "1340538", "21147", "327061", "21714", "1195815", "305286", "5042951", "230364", "24026", "317350", "186633", "29376", "27067", "71088", "15704166", "3696045", "62278", "8145410", "89796", "181541", "466322", "45756", "9239", "4620", "157774", "6591", "44736", "2402376", "1219865", "18976", "26685803", "52995", "201635", "5658", "94248", "2061529", "6423", "488341", "15165", "1525", "6494435", "17369680", "182051", "24707", "65828", "13459", "42888", "557672", "38493", "569092", "188518", "21495014", "20917738", "31853", "20976473", "143912", "93084", "12933417", "199665", "26667", "380541", "18450", "17006", "499291", "3263", "44603", "518513", "506239", "310411", "51970", "72967", "47326", "56896", "482629", "88295", "30463", "50397", "49375"]}

It is a white bird with a slender black beak long black legs and in the western race yellow feet. As an aquatic bird it feeds in shallow water and on land consuming a variety of small creatures. It breeds colonially often with other species of water birds making a platform nest of sticks in a tree bush or reed bed. A clutch of three to five bluish green eggs is laid and incubated by both parents for about three weeks. The young fledge at about six weeks of age. Its breeding distribution is in wetlands in warm temperate to tropical parts of Europe Africa Asia and Australia. A successful colonist its range has gradually expanded north with stable and self sustaining populations now present in the United Kingdom. In warmer locations most birds are permanent residents northern populations including many European birds migrate to Africa and southern Asia to over winter there. The birds may also wander north in late summer after the breeding season and their tendency to disperse may have assisted in the recent expansion of the bird s range. At one time common in Western Europe it was hunted extensively in the 19th century to provide plumes for the decoration of hats and became locally extinct in northwestern Europe and scarce in the south. Around 1950 conservation laws were introduced in southern Europe to protect the species and their numbers began to increase. By the beginning of the 21st century the bird was breeding again in France the Netherlands Ireland and Britain.

{"id": "27984", "abstract": ["In nuclear physics and particle physics the strong interaction strong nuclear force is one of the four known fundamental interactions with the others being electromagnetism the weak interaction weak nuclear force and gravitation. At the range of 10 15 m slightly more than the radius of a nucleon the strong force is approximately 137 times as strong as electromagnetism 106 times as strong as the weak interaction and 1038 times as strong as gravitation. The strong nuclear force confines quarks into hadron particles such as the proton and neutron. In addition the strong force binds these neutrons and protons to create atomic nuclei where it is called the nuclear force. Most of the mass of a common proton or neutron is the result of the strong force field energy the individual quarks provide only about 1 of the mass of a proton. The strong interaction is observable at two ranges and mediated by two force carriers. On a larger scale of about 1 to 3 femtometer it is the force carried by mesons that binds protons and neutrons nucleons together to form the nucleus of an atom. On the smaller scale less than about 0.8 fm the radius of a nucleon it is the force carried by gluons that holds quarks together to form protons neutrons and other hadron particles. In the latter context it is often known as the color force . The strong force inherently has such a high strength that hadrons bound by the strong force can produce new massive particles. Thus if hadrons are struck by high energy particles they give rise to new hadrons instead of emitting freely moving radiation gluons . This property of the strong force is called color confinement and it prevents the free emission of the strong force instead in practice jets of massive particles are produced. In the context of atomic nuclei the same strong interaction force that binds quarks within a nucleon also binds protons and neutrons together to form a nucleus. In this capacity it is called the nuclear force or residual strong force . So the residuum from the strong interaction within protons and neutrons also binds nuclei together. As such the residual strong interaction obeys a distance dependent behavior between nucleons that is quite different from that when it is acting to bind quarks within nucleons. Additionally distinctions exist in the binding energies of the nuclear force of nuclear fusion vs nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion accounts for most energy production in the Sun and other stars. Nuclear fission allows for decay of radioactive elements and isotopes although it is often mediated by the weak interaction. Artificially the energy associated with the nuclear force is partially released in nuclear power and nuclear weapons both in uranium or plutonium based fission weapons and in fusion weapons like the hydrogen bomb. The strong interaction is mediated by the exchange of massless particles called gluons that act between quarks antiquarks and other gluons. Gluons are thought to interact with quarks and other gluons by way of a type of charge called color charge. Color charge is analogous to electromagnetic charge but it comes in three types red green blue rather than one which results in a different type of force with different rules of behavior. These rules are detailed in the theory of quantum chromodynamics QCD which is the theory of quark gluon interactions."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Physics", "Physics basics"], "title": "Strong interaction", "headers": ["History", "Behavior of the strong force", "Residual strong force", "Unification", "See also", "References", "Further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["1982496", "23259", "18616290", "13821", "26808", "19600416", "70657", "4584", "430790", "31743", "33629", "21961", "4116", "21544", "4370125", "9804", "21285", "10890", "23317", "38579", "1327", "673", "1919367", "72540", "41890", "10103", "36961", "19916559", "125769", "422481", "12666", "23535", "18589032", "7987684", "17747", "22054", "20728", "26751", "21272", "22153", "25267", "25264", "4370036", "23912155", "3043836", "25179", "902", "9532", "180870", "19870", "183089", "12610"]}

{"id": "293054", "abstract": ["A blockade is the act of actively preventing a country or region from receiving or sending out food supplies weapons or communications and sometimes people by military force. A blockade differs from an embargo or sanction which are legal barriers to trade rather than physical barriers. It is also distinct from a siege in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region rather than a fortress or city and the objective may not always be to conquer the area. While most blockades historically took place at sea blockades are also used on land to prevent entrance of an area. For example Armenia is a landlocked country that Turkey and Azerbaijan blockade. Thus Armenia cannot conduct international trade through those countries and mainly trades through Georgia. This restricts the country s economic development. A blockading power can seek to cut off all maritime transport from and to the blockaded country although stopping all land transport to and from an area may also be considered a blockade. Blockades restrict the trading rights of neutrals who must submit for inspection for contraband which the blockading power may define narrowly or broadly sometimes including food and medicine. In the 20th century air power has also been used to enhance the effectiveness of the blockade by halting air traffic within the blockaded airspace. Close patrol of hostile ports in order to prevent naval forces from putting to sea is also referred to as a blockade. When coastal cities or fortresses were besieged from the landward side the besiegers would often blockade the seaward side as well. Most recently blockades have sometimes included cutting off electronic communications by jamming radio signals and severing undersea cables."], "label": ["Society and social sciences", "Politic and economic", "War and military"], "title": "Blockade", "headers": ["History", "Types of blockade", "Legal status", "Blockade planning", "Blockade running", "See also", "References"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["746", "374673", "204118", "3354", "19039354", "10646", "3524561", "118392", "31956", "52738", "863", "26779", "2024656", "21212", "45206", "5843419", "38855", "26905", "7023", "21785", "10918072", "5119376", "57765", "548500", "3736", "3383", "32927", "5042481", "18951905", "6827", "5177", "61403", "477859", "25391", "57912", "65787", "4757142", "193526", "27238", "9508", "48768"]}

{"id": "299696", "abstract": ["Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky born 26 June 1963 is an exiled Russian businessman philanthropist and former oligarch now residing in London. In 2003 Khodorkovsky was believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia with a fortune estimated to be worth 15billion and was ranked 16th on Forbes list of billionaires. He had worked his way up the Komsomol apparatus during the Soviet years and started several businesses during the period of glasnost and perestroika in the late 1980s. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the mid 1990s he accumulated considerable wealth by obtaining control of a number of Siberian oil fields unified under the name Yukos one of the major companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets during the 1990s a scheme known as Loans for Shares . In October 2003 he was arrested by Russian authorities and charged with fraud. The government under Vladimir Putin President of the Russian Federation then froze shares of Yukos shortly thereafter on tax charges. Putin s government took further actions against Yukos leading to a collapse of the company s share price and the evaporation of much of Khodorkovsky s wealth. In May 2005 he was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison. In December 2010 while he was still serving his sentence Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were further charged with and found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering Khodorkovsky s prison sentence was extended to 2014. After Hans Dietrich Genscher lobbied for his release President Vladimir Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky releasing him from jail on 20 December 2013. There was widespread concern internationally that the trials and sentencing were politically motivated. The trial was criticized abroad for the lack of due process. Khodorkovsky lodged several applications with the European Court of Human Rights seeking redress for alleged violations by Russia of his human rights. In response to his first application which concerned events from 2003 to 2005 the court found that several violations were committed by the Russian authorities in their treatment of Khodorkovsky. Despite these findings the court ultimately ruled that the trial was not politically motivated but rather that the charges against him were grounded in reasonable suspicion . He was considered to be a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. On being pardoned by Putin and released from prison at the end of 2013 Khodorkovsky immediately left Russia and was granted residency in Switzerland. At the end of 2013 his personal estate was believed to be worth as a rough estimate 100 250 million. At the end of 2014 he was said to be worth about 500 million. In 2015 he moved to London. In December 2016 the Dublin District Court unfroze 100m of Khodorkovsky s assets that had been held in the Republic of Ireland. In 2014 Khodorkovsky re launched Open Russia to promote several reforms to Russian civil society including free and fair elections political education protection of journalists and activists endorsing the rule of law and ensuring media independence.

At the end of 2010 Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe. The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family through special Class B shares still retain 40 percent of the voting rights. During the financial crisis of 2007 08 the company struggled financially almost to the point of collapse from which it was in large part rescued by President George W. Bush announcing his emergency financial rescue plan to help Ford Motors as well as Chrysler LLC and General Motors making immediately available 13.4 billion to the automaker. Ford Motors has since returned to profitability and was the eleventh ranked overall American based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list based on global revenues in 2017 of 156.7 billion.

Makhno was the commander of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine commonly referred to as the Makhnovshchina loosely translated as Makhno movement . The Makhnovshchina was a predominantly peasant phenomenon that grew into a mass social movement. It was initially centered around Makhno s hometown Huliaipole but over the course of the Russian Civil War came to exert a strong influence over large areas of southern Ukraine. Makhno and the movement s leadership were anarcho communists and attempted to guide the movement along these ideological lines. Makhno was aggressively opposed to all factions that sought to impose their authority over southern Ukraine battling in succession the forces of the Ukrainian National Republic the Central Powers of Germany and Austro Hungary the Hetmanate state the White Army the Bolshevik Red Army and other smaller forces led by various Ukrainian atamans. He is also credited as the inventor of the tachanka a horse drawn carriage with a mounted heavy machine gun. Makhno and his supporters attempted to reorganize social and economic life along anarchist lines including the establishment of communes on former landed estates the requisition and egalitarian redistribution of land to the peasants and the organization of free elections to local soviets councils and regional congresses. However the disruption of the civil war precluded a stable territorial base for any long term social experiments. Although Makhno considered the Bolsheviks a threat to the development of an anarchist Free Territory within Ukraine he entered into formal military alliances twice with the Red Army to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the White Army s defeat in Crimea in November 1920 the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno. After an extended period of open resistance against the Red Army Makhno fled across the Romanian border in August 1921. In exile Makhno settled in Paris with his wife Halyna and daughter Yelena. During this period Makhno wrote numerous memoirs and articles for radical newspapers. Makhno also played an important role in the development of platformism and the debates around the 1926 Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft .

{"id": "30876250", "abstract": ["Jayaram Jayalalithaa 24 February 1948 5 December 2016 was an Indian politician actress and philanthropist who served as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu for more than fourteen years between 1991 and 2016. From 9 February 1989 she was the general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam AIADMK a Dravidian party whose cadre revered her as their Mother and Revolutionary leader . Her critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a personality cult and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers who often publicly prostrated themselves before her. Jayalalithaa first came into prominence as a leading film actress in the mid 1960s. Though she had entered the profession reluctantly upon the urging of her mother to support the family Jayalalithaa worked prolifically. She appeared in 140 films between 1961 and 1980 primarily in the Tamil Telugu and Kannada languages. Jayalalithaa received praise for her versatility as an actress and for her dancing skills earning the sobriquet Queen of Tamil Cinema . Among her frequent co stars was M. G. Ramachandran popularly known as M.G.R. a Tamil cultural icon who leveraged his immense popularity with the masses into a successful political career. In 1982 when M.G.R. was chief minister Jayalalithaa joined the AIADMK the party he founded. Her political rise was rapid within a few years she became AIADMK propaganda secretary and was elected to the Rajya Sabha the upper house of India s Parliament. After M.G.R. s death in 1987 Jayalalithaa proclaimed herself his political heir and having fought off the faction headed by M.G.R. s widow V. N. Janaki Ramachandran emerged as the sole leader of the AIADMK. Following the 1989 election she became Leader of the Opposition to the DMK led government headed by M. Karunanidhi her b\u00eate noire . In 1991 Jayalalithaa became chief minister for the first time and Tamil Nadu s youngest. She earned a reputation for centralising state power among a coterie of bureaucrats her council of ministers whom she often shuffled around were largely ceremonial in nature. The successful cradle baby scheme which enabled mothers to anonymously offer their newborns for adoption emerged during this time. Despite an official salary of only a rupee a month Jayalalithaa indulged in public displays of wealth culminating in a lavish wedding for her foster son V. N. Sudhakaran Sasikala s elder sister son on 7 September 1995. In the 1996 election the AIADMK was nearly wiped out at the hustings Jayalalithaa herself lost her seat. The new Karunanidhi government filed several corruption cases against her and she had to spend time in jail. Her fortunes revived in the 1998 general election as the AIADMK became a key component of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee s 1998 99 government her withdrawal of support toppled it and triggered another general election just a year later. The AIADMK returned to power in 2001 although Jayalalithaa was personally disbarred from contesting due to the corruption cases. Within a few months of her taking oath as chief minister in September 2001 she was disqualified from holding office and forced to cede the chair to minister O. Panneerselvam. Upon her acquittal six months later Jayalalithaa returned as chief minister to complete her term. Noted for its ruthlessness to political opponents many of whom were arrested in midnight raids her government grew unpopular. Another period 2006 11 in the opposition followed before Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time after the AIADMK swept the 2011 assembly election. Her government received attention for its extensive social welfare agenda which included several subsidised branded goods such as canteens bottled water salt and cement. Three years into her tenure she was convicted in a disproportionate assets case rendering her disqualified to hold office. She returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In the 2016 assembly election she became the first Tamil Nadu chief minister since M.G.R in 1984 to be voted back into office. That September she fell severely ill and following 75 days of hospitalisation died on 5 December 2016 due to cardiac arrest and became the first female chief minister in India to die in office. Jayalalithaa never married and had no children. On 29 May 2020 her nephew J.

{"id": "31726", "abstract": ["The United Kingdom is a unitary state with devolution that is governed within the framework of a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch currently Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state while the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom currently Boris Johnson is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the British government on behalf of and by the consent of the monarch and the devolved governments of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom the House of Commons and the House of Lords as well as in the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. The British political system is a two party system. Since the 1920s the two dominant parties have been the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. Before the Labour Party rose in British politics the Liberal Party was the other major political party along with the Conservatives. While coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics the first past the post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties though each has in the past century relied upon a third party such as the Liberal Democrats to deliver a working majority in Parliament. A Conservative Liberal Democrat coalition government held office from 2010 until 2015 the first coalition since 1945. The coalition ended following parliamentary elections on 7 May 2015 in which the Conservative Party won an outright majority of seats 330 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons while their coalition partners lost all but eight seats. With the partition of Ireland Northern Ireland received home rule in 1920 though civil unrest meant direct rule was restored in 1972. Support for nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales led to proposals for devolution in the 1970s though only in the 1990s did devolution happen. Today Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and executive with devolution in Northern Ireland being conditional on participation in certain all Ireland institutions. The British government remains responsible for non devolved matters and in the case of Northern Ireland co operates with the government of the Republic of Ireland. Devolution of executive and legislative powers may have contributed to increased support for independence in the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. The principal Scottish pro independence party the Scottish National Party became a minority government in 2007 and then went on to win an overall majority of MSPs at the 2011 Scottish parliament elections and forms the current Scottish Government administration. In a 2014 referendum on independence 44.7 of voters voted for independence versus 55.3 against. In Northern Ireland Irish nationalist parties such as Sinn F\u00e9in advocate Irish reunification.

Abused by his father Ramirez began developing gruesome macabre interests in his early and mid teens from his older cousin Miguel Mike Ramirez who allegedly also taught him some of the military skills that he would go on to use during his year long killing spree. Ramirez also cultivated a strong interest in Satanism and the occult. By the time he had left his home in Texas and moved to California at the age of 22 he had begun frequently using cocaine. Ramirez would often commit burglaries to support his drug addiction many of which were later frequently accompanied by murders attempted murders rapes and assaults. Ramirez s highly publicized home invasion and murder spree terrorized the residents of the Greater Los Angeles area and later the San Francisco Bay Area over the course of fourteen months. However his first known murder occurred as early as April 1984 this crime was not connected to Ramirez nor was it known to be his doing until 2009. Ramirez used a wide variety of weapons and different murder methods including handguns various types of knives a machete a tire iron and a claw hammer. He was known to attack by punching pistol whipping and strangling many of his victims both manually with his hands and in one instance a ligature stomped at least one victim to death in her sleep and tortured another victim by shocking her with a live electrical cord. Ramirez also enjoyed frequently degrading and humiliating his victims especially those who survived his attacks or whom he explicitly decided not to kill by forcing them to profess that they loved Satan or telling them to swear on Satan if there were no more valuables left in their homes he had broken into and burglarized. In 1989 Ramirez was convicted of thirteen counts of murder five attempted murders eleven sexual assaults and fourteen burglaries.

{"id": "323777", "abstract": ["Irreligion or nonreligion is the absence or rejection of religion or indifference to it. Irreligion takes many forms ranging from the casual and unaware to full fledged philosophies such as secular humanism. Other examples are atheism agnosticism and antitheism. Social scientists tend to define irreligion as a purely naturalist worldview that excludes a belief in anything supernatural. The broadest and loosest definition serving as an upper limit is the lack of religious identification though many non identifiers express metaphysical and even religious beliefs. The narrowest and strictest is subscribing to positive atheism. According to the Pew Research Center s 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories 16 of the world s population is not affiliated with any religion.

{"id": "324570", "abstract": ["Academic publishing is the subfield of publishing which distributes academic research and scholarship. Most academic work is published in academic journal articles books or theses. The part of academic written output that is not formally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often called grey literature . Most scientific and scholarly journals and many academic and scholarly books though not all are based on some form of peer review or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication. Peer review quality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal publisher to publisher and field to field. Most established academic disciplines have their own journals and other outlets for publication although many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. There is also a tendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field itself becomes more specialized. Along with the variation in review and publication procedures the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and subfields. In the sciences the desire for statistically significant results leads to publication bias. Academic publishing is undergoing major changes as it makes the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since the early 1990s licensing of electronic resources particularly journals has been very common. An important trend particularly with respect to journals in the sciences is open access via the Internet. In open access publishing a journal article is made available free for all on the web by the publisher at the time of publication. Both open and closed journals are sometimes funded by the author paying an article processing charge thereby shifting some fees from the reader to the researcher or their funder. Many open or closed journals fund their operations without such fees and others use them in predatory publishing. The Internet has facilitated open access self archiving in which authors themselves make a copy of their published articles available free for all on the web. Some important results in mathematics have been published only on arXiv."], "label": ["Society and social sciences", "Culture", "Journalism and mass media"], "title": "Academic publishing", "headers": ["History", "Publishers and business aspects", "Scholarly paper", "Peer review", "Publishing process", "Citations", "Publishing by discipline", "Open access journals", "Growth", "Role for publishers in scholarly communication", "See also", "References", "Further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["26833", "9223", "9253", "3778", "17416221", "9317", "53132", "68761", "5323", "3434750", "324572", "463734", "9506", "39282948", "18960210", "39206", "230600", "18949668", "5042916", "26781", "16829895", "3383", "14532", "2421203", "59126142", "381219", "14533", "32473", "62750956", "78449", "25524", "24116", "1835316", "14627", "3036500", "45642", "496064", "12281", "16017237", "18957", "203896", "5510345", "26700"]}

It is used to prevent and treat scurvy. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue the formation of collagen and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function. It also functions as an antioxidant. Most animals are able to synthesize their own vitamin C. However apes including humans and monkeys but not all primates most bats some rodents and certain other animals must acquire it from dietary sources. There is some evidence that regular use of supplements may reduce the duration of the common cold but it does not appear to prevent infection. It is unclear whether supplementation affects the risk of cancer cardiovascular disease or dementia. It may be taken by mouth or by injection. Vitamin C is generally well tolerated. Large doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort headache trouble sleeping and flushing of the skin. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy. The United States Institute of Medicine recommends against taking large doses. Vitamin C was discovered in 1912 isolated in 1928 and in 1933 was the first vitamin to be chemically produced. It is on the World Health Organization s List of Essential Medicines. Vitamin C is available as an inexpensive generic and over the counter medication. Partly for its discovery Albert Szent Gy\u00f6rgyi and Walter Norman Haworth were awarded the 1937 Nobel Prizes in Physiology and Medicine and Chemistry respectively.

Methods dating back to 17th century techniques developed by Nicholas Steno including the so called law of superposition and stratigraphy used to estimate the geological histories of Earth and the Moon are being actively applied to the data available from several Martian observational and measurement resources. These include the landers orbiting platforms Earth based observations and Martian meteorites. Observations of the surfaces of many Solar System bodies reveal important clues about their evolution. For example a lava flow that spreads out and fills a large impact crater is likely to be younger than the crater. On the other hand a small crater on top of the same lava flow is likely to be younger than both the lava and the larger crater since it can be surmised to have been the product of a later unobserved geological event. This principle called the law of superposition along with other principles of stratigraphy first formulated by Nicholas Steno in the 17th century allowed geologists of the 19th century to divide the history of the Earth into the familiar eras of Paleozoic Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The same methodology was later applied to the Moon and then to Mars. Another stratigraphic principle used on planets where impact craters are well preserved is that of crater number density. The number of craters greater than a given size per unit surface area usually million km2 provides a relative age for that surface. Heavily cratered surfaces are old and sparsely cratered surfaces are young. Old surfaces have many big craters and young surfaces have mostly small craters or none at all.

Other examples of zero sum games in daily life include games like poker chess and bridge where one person gains and another person loses which results in a zero net benefit for every player. In the markets and financial instruments futures contracts and options are zero sum games as well. Nevertheless the situation like the stock market etc. is not a zero sum game because investors could gain profit or loss from share price influences by profit forecasts or economic outlooks rather than gain profit from other investors losses. In contrast non zero sum describes a situation in which the interacting parties aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero. A zero sum game is also called a strictly competitive game while non zero sum games can be either competitive or non competitive.

Berezovsky made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s when the country implemented privatization of state property. He profited from gaining control over assets including the country s main television channel Channel One. In 1997 Forbes estimated Berezovsky s wealth at US 3 billion. Berezovsky helped fund Unity the political party that would form Vladimir Putin s first parliamentary base and was elected to the Duma on Putin s slate in the 1999 Russian legislative election. However following the Russian presidential election in March 2000 Berezovsky went into opposition and resigned from the Duma. Berezovsky would remain a vocal critic of Putin for the rest of his life. In late 2000 after the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General demanded that Berezovsky appear for questioning he did not return from abroad and moved to the UK which granted him political asylum in 2003. After he moved to Britain the Russian government took over his television assets and he divested from other Russian holdings. In Russia Berezovsky was later convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement. The first charges had been brought during Primakov s government in 1999. Despite an Interpol Red Notice for Berezovsky s arrest Russia repeatedly failed to obtain the extradition of Berezovsky from Britain the situation became a major point of diplomatic tension between the two countries.

{"id": "37232", "abstract": ["Fermat s principle also known as the principle of least time is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original strong form Fermat s principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases this statement must be weakened by replacing the least time with a time that is stationary with respect to variations of the path so that a deviation in the path causes at most a second order change in the traversal time. To put it loosely a ray path is surrounded by close paths that can be traversed in very close times. It can be shown that this technical definition corresponds to more intuitive notions of a ray such as a line of sight or the path of a narrow beam. First proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1662 as a means of explaining the ordinary law of refraction of light Fig.1 Fermat s principle was initially controversial because it seemed to ascribe knowledge and intent to nature. Not until the 19th century was it understood that nature s ability to test alternative paths is merely a fundamental property of waves. If points A and B are given a wavefront expanding from A sweeps all possible ray paths radiating from A whether they pass through B or not. If the wavefront reaches point B it sweeps not only the ray path s from A to B but also an infinitude of nearby paths with the same endpoints. Fermat s principle describes any ray that happens to reach point B there is no implication that the ray knew the quickest path or intended to take that path. For the purpose of comparing traversal times the time from one point to the next nominated point is taken as if the first point were a point source . Without this condition the traversal time would be ambiguous for example if the propagation time from to were reckoned from an arbitrary wavefront W containing Fig.2 that time could be made arbitrarily small by suitably angling the wavefront.

Examples of complex systems are Earth s global climate organisms the human brain infrastructure such as power grid transportation or communication systems complex software and electronic systems social and economic organizations like cities an ecosystem a living cell and ultimately the entire universe. Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies competitions relationships or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are complex have distinct properties that arise from these relationships such as nonlinearity emergence spontaneous order adaptation and feedback loops among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research. In many cases it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and links to their interactions. The term complex systems often refers to the study of complex systems which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system s parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment. The study of complex systems regards collective or system wide behaviors as the fundamental object of study for this reason complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to reductionism which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them. As an interdisciplinary domain complex systems draws contributions from many different fields such as the study of self organization and critical phenomena from physics that of spontaneous order from the social sciences chaos from mathematics adaptation from biology and many others.

A thermoconforming organism by contrast simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis a state of dynamic stability in an organism s internal conditions maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above for six hours. The opposite condition when body temperature decreases below normal levels is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range. It was not until the introduction of thermometers that any exact data on the temperature of animals could be obtained. It was then found that local differences were present since heat production and heat loss vary considerably in different parts of the body although the circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature of the internal parts. Hence it is important to identify the parts of the body that most closely reflect the temperature of the internal organs. Also for such results to be comparable the measurements must be conducted under comparable conditions. The rectum has traditionally been considered to reflect most accurately the temperature of internal parts or in some cases of sex or species the vagina uterus or bladder.

{"id": "37913", "abstract": ["In celestial mechanics escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free non propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term escape velocity is common it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body. The escape speed thus depends on how far the object has already traveled and its calculation at a given distance takes into account the fact that without new acceleration it will slow down as it travels due to the massive body s gravity but it will never quite slow to a stop. A rocket continuously accelerated by its exhaust can escape without ever reaching escape speed since it continues to add kinetic energy from its engines. It can achieve escape at any speed given sufficient propellant to provide new acceleration to the rocket to counter gravity s deceleration and thus maintain its speed. More generally escape velocity is the speed at which the sum of an object s kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy is equal to zero an object which has achieved escape velocity is neither on the surface nor in a closed orbit of any radius . With escape velocity in a direction pointing away from the ground of a massive body the object will move away from the body slowing forever and approaching but never reaching zero speed. Once escape velocity is achieved no further impulse need be applied for it to continue in its escape. In other words if given escape velocity the object will move away from the other body continually slowing and will asymptotically approach zero speed as the object s distance approaches infinity never to come back. Speeds higher than escape velocity retain a positive speed at infinite distance. Note that the minimum escape velocity assumes that there is no friction e.g. atmospheric drag which would increase the required instantaneous velocity to escape the gravitational influence and that there will be no future acceleration or extraneous deceleration for example from thrust or from gravity of other bodies which would change the required instantaneous velocity. Escape speed at a distance d from the center of a spherically symmetric primary body such as a star or a planet with mass M is given by the formula where G is the universal gravitational constant . The escape speed is independent of the mass of the escaping object. For example the escape speed from Earth s surface is about . When given an initial speed greater than the escape speed the object will asymptotically approach the hyperbolic excess speed satisfying the equation In these equations atmospheric friction air drag is not taken into account."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Astronomy", "Celestial mechanics"], "title": "Escape velocity", "headers": ["Overview", "Scenarios", "Trajectory", "List of escape velocities", "Deriving escape velocity using calculus", "See also", "Notes", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["19003265", "47568", "102182", "44371", "53306", "22915", "43126", "13127410", "23231", "155758", "19331", "147853", "44158", "2589714", "32745", "20611356", "44474", "579026", "9951602", "1051892", "173961", "20491903", "29320146", "18426568", "43127", "4650", "20110824", "28736", "39378", "17327", "19694", "20584918", "28748", "5595163", "44475", "9228", "44469", "14640471", "26903", "67088", "38454", "54211", "26751", "3383505", "30001", "277468", "47402", "38930"]}

Tetrapods under the apomorphy based definition used on this page are categorized as animals in the biological superclass Tetrapoda which includes all living and extinct amphibians reptiles birds and mammals. While most species today are terrestrial little evidence supports the idea that any of the earliest tetrapods could move about on land as their limbs could not have held their midsections off the ground and the known trackways do not indicate they dragged their bellies around. Presumably the tracks were made by animals walking along the bottoms of shallow bodies of water. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods and the process by which land colonization occurred remain unclear. They are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. Most amphibians today remain semiaquatic living the first stage of their lives as fish like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods such as the snakes and cetaceans have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians .

{"id": "38248", "abstract": ["Turandot see below is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini posthumously completed by Franco Alfano in 1926 and set to a libretto in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. Turandot best known aria is Nessun dorma which became globally popular in the 1990s following Luciano Pavarotti s performance of it for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Though Puccini first became interested in the subject matter when reading Friedrich Schiller s 1801 adaptation he based his work more closely on the earlier play Turandot 1762 by Count Carlo Gozzi. The original story is one of the seven stories in the epic Haft Peykar a work by twelfth century Persian poet Nizami 1141 1209 . Nizami aligned his seven stories with the seven days of the week the seven colors and the seven planets known in his era. This particular narrative is the story of Tuesday as told to the king of Iran Bahram V by his companion of the red dome associated with Mars. In the first line of the story the protagonist is identified as a Russian princess. The name of the opera is based on Turan Dokht daughter of Turan which is a name frequently used in Persian poetry for Central Asian princesses. The opera s version of the story is set in China. It involves Prince Calaf who falls in love with the cold Princess Turandot. In order to obtain permission to marry her a suitor must solve three riddles. Any single wrong answer will result in the suitor s execution. Calaf passes the test but Turandot refuses to marry him. He offers her a way out if she is able to guess his name before dawn the next day he will accept death. In the original story by Nizami the princess sets four conditions firstly a good name and good deeds and then the three challenges. As with Madama Butterfly Puccini strove for a semblance of authenticity at least to Western ears by integrating music from the region. Up to eight of the musical themes in Turandot appear to be based on traditional Chinese music and anthems and the melody of a Chinese song M\u00f2 Li H a or Jasmine became a motif for the princess. Puccini left the opera unfinished at the time of his death in 1924 Franco Alfano completed it in 1926. The first performance took place at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 25 April 1926 conducted by Arturo Toscanini. The performance included only Puccini s music without Alfano s additions. The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was performed on the next evening 26 April although it is disputed whether the second performance was conducted by Toscanini or by Ettore Panizza."], "label": ["Arts", "Arts", "Music"], "title": "Turandot", "headers": ["Origin and pronunciation of the name", "Composition history", "Performance history", "Roles", "Synopsis", "Critical response", "Instrumentation", "Recordings", "Notes", "References", "Further reading", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["274721", "22206", "105219", "42279", "22348", "11077999", "202639", "12750", "433760", "156198", "21438575", "11456", "672391", "261659", "140698", "6433", "5876413", "1716967", "29697232", "556372", "5671", "70500", "304379", "18603746", "6742", "18411084", "1350006", "149832", "19242322", "38246", "140758", "38245", "4207", "42823962", "136566", "227696", "30353", "166362", "590473", "23588", "153560", "46950", "27188", "69346", "13825970", "166408", "30680", "64213", "60520", "82848", "87950", "84576", "52875", "63742", "11600", "781005", "54635", "52867", "70502", "31600", "13911"]}

Among his best known marches are The Stars and Stripes Forever National March of the United States of America Semper Fidelis official march of the United States Marine Corps The Liberty Bell The Thunderer and The Washington Post . Sousa began his career playing violin and studying music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert.

In 1880 he rejoined the Marine Band and he served there for 12 years as director after which he was hired to conduct a band organized by David Blakely P.S. Gilmore s former agent. Blakely wanted to compete with Gilmore. From 1880 until his death he focused exclusively on conducting and writing music. Sousa aided in the development of the sousaphone a large brass instrument similar to the helicon and tuba. Upon the outbreak of World War I Sousa was awarded a wartime commission of lieutenant commander to lead the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois.

{"id": "4034788", "abstract": ["Aggradation or alluviation is the term used in geology for the increase in land elevation typically in a river system due to the deposition of sediment. Aggradation occurs in areas in which the supply of sediment is greater than the amount of material that the system is able to transport. The mass balance between sediment being transported and sediment in the bed is described by the Exner equation. Typical aggradational environments include lowland alluvial rivers river deltas and alluvial fans. Aggradational environments are often undergoing slow subsidence which balances the increase in land surface elevation due to aggradation. After millions of years an aggradational environment will become a sedimentary basin which contains the deposited sediment including paleochannels and ancient floodplains. Aggradation can be caused by changes in climate land use and geologic activity such as volcanic eruption earthquakes and faulting. For example volcanic eruptions may lead to rivers carrying more sediment than the flow can transport this leads to the burial of the old channel and its floodplain. In another example the quantity of sediment entering a river channel may increase when climate becomes drier. The increase in sediment is caused by a decrease in soil binding that results from plant growth being suppressed. The drier conditions cause river flow to decrease at the same time as sediment is being supplied in greater quantities resulting in the river becoming choked with sediment. In 2009 a report by researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder in the journal Nature Geoscience said that reduced aggradation was contributing to an increased risk of flooding in many river deltas."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Earth science", "Earth"], "title": "Aggradation", "headers": ["See also", "External links", "References"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["70117", "182787", "5999", "406430", "12207", "183957", "7999492", "10106", "182732", "246018", "166931", "18842395"]}

{"id": "412735", "abstract": ["Rheumatic fever RF is an inflammatory disease that can involve the heart joints skin and brain. The disease typically develops two to four weeks after a streptococcal throat infection. Signs and symptoms include fever multiple painful joints involuntary muscle movements and occasionally a characteristic non itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of the cases. Damage to the heart valves known as rheumatic heart disease RHD usually occurs after repeated attacks but can sometimes occur after one. The damaged valves may result in heart failure atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves. Rheumatic fever may occur following an infection of the throat by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes . If the infection is left untreated rheumatic fever occurs in up to three percent of people. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the production of antibodies against a person s own tissues. Due to their genetics some people are more likely to get the disease when exposed to the bacteria than others. Other risk factors include malnutrition and poverty. Diagnosis of RF is often based on the presence of signs and symptoms in combination with evidence of a recent streptococcal infection. Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics such as penicillin decreases the risk of developing rheumatic fever. In order to avoid antibiotic misuse this often involves testing people with sore throats for the infection however testing might not be available in the developing world. Other preventive measures include improved sanitation. In those with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease prolonged periods of antibiotics are sometimes recommended. Gradual return to normal activities may occur following an attack. Once RHD develops treatment is more difficult. Occasionally valve replacement surgery or valve repair is required. Otherwise complications are treated as usual. Rheumatic fever occurs in about 325 000 children each year and about 33.4 million people currently have rheumatic heart disease. Those who develop RF are most often between the ages of 5 and 14 with 20 of first time attacks occurring in adults. The disease is most common in the developing world and among indigenous peoples in the developed world. In 2015 it resulted in 319 400 deaths down from 374 000 deaths in 1990. Most deaths occur in the developing world where as many as 12.5 of people affected may die each year.

Some features of Internet culture include online communities gaming and social media as well as topics related to identity and privacy. Due to the internet s large scale use and adoption the impacts of internet culture on society and non digital cultures have been widespread. Additionally due to the encompassing nature of the internet and internet culture different facets of internet culture are often studied individually rather than holistically such as social media gaming and specific communities. The cultural history of the internet involves rapid change. The internet evolved in parallel with rapid and sustained technological advances in computing and data communication with also an increasing breadth of access as the cost structure declined over multiple orders of magnitude. Each technological era spawned a distinct cultural response. As its outset digital culture tilted toward the Anglosphere. Due to computer technology s early reliance on textual coding systems suited mainly to the English language Anglophone societies followed by other societies with languages based on Latin script mostly European enjoyed privileged access to digital culture from the early beginnings in the late 1960s before globally multilingual software became ubiquitous in the 2010s. Additionally it was not until the advent of inexpensive smartphones that internet culture began to close the societal wealth divide. Psychologically electronic and digital culture is engrossing for many participants to such a degree that it sometimes seems to compete with physical reality. For many years the term cyberspace was synonymous with digital culture having first appeared in fiction in the 1980s in the work of cyberpunk science fiction author William Gibson notably in his 1984 novel Neuromancer . This work romanticized digital culture as an alternate world of an entirely different social order with distinct limitations and possibilities. Excessive neglect of the traditional physical and social world in favour of internet culture became codified as a medical condition under the diagnosis of internet addiction disorder. Nevertheless internet culture seems destined to plunge headlong into the metaverse.

Born in Ta if Mukhtar moved to Iraq at a young age and grew up in Kufa. Following the death of Husayn ibn Ali a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad at the hands of the Umayyad army in the Battle of Karbala in 680 he allied with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr in Mecca but the alliance was short lived. Mukhtar returned to Kufa where he declared Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyyah a son of caliph Ali r. 656 661 and brother of Husayn the mahdi and the imam and called for the establishment of an Alid caliphate and retaliation for Husayn s killing. He took over Kufa in October 685 after expelling its Zubayrid governor and later ordered the execution of those involved in the killing of Husayn. Hostile relations with Ibn al Zubayr ultimately led to Mukhtar s death by the forces of the Zubayrid governor of Basra Mus ab ibn al Zubayr following a four month siege. Although Mukhtar was defeated his movement would have far reaching consequences. After his death his followers formed a radical Shi a sect later known as the Kaysanites who developed several novel doctrines and influenced later Shi a ideology. Mukhtar raised the social status of mawali non Arab local converts to Islam and they became an important political entity. The mawali and Kaysanites went on to play a significant role in the Abbasid Revolution sixty years later. Mukhtar was important as an early proponent of treating Arab and non Arab Muslims on an equal footing.

Some parody religions emphasise having fun the new faith may serve as a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among the like minded. One approach of parody religions aims to highlight deficiencies in particular pro religious arguments following the logic that if a given argument can also be used to support a clear parody then the original argument is clearly flawed. An example of this is the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster which parodies the demand for equal time employed by intelligent design and creationism. Occasionally a parody religion may offer ordination by mail or on line at a nominal fee seeking equal recognition for its clergy officiants under freedom of religion provisions including the 1st and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution to legally solemnise marriages. Parody religions also have sought the same reasonable accommodation legally afforded to mainstream religions including religious specific garb or headgear. A U.S. federal court ruled in 2016 that Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Pastafarianism is not a religion but Pastafarianism or The Church of the Latter Day Dude Dudeism have been accommodated to some extent by a few U.S. states and by some other countries.

These concepts may originate in real world concerns and the results obtained may later turn out to be useful for practical applications but pure mathematicians are not primarily motivated by such applications. Instead the appeal is attributed to the intellectual challenge and aesthetic beauty of working out the logical consequences of basic principles. While pure mathematics has existed as an activity since at least Ancient Greece the concept was elaborated upon around the year 1900 after the introduction of theories with counter intuitive properties such as non Euclidean geometries and Cantor s theory of infinite sets and the discovery of apparent paradoxes such as continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable and Russell s paradox . This introduced the need to renew the concept of mathematical rigor and rewrite all mathematics accordingly with a systematic use of axiomatic methods. This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake that is pure mathematics. Nevertheless almost all mathematical theories remained motivated by problems coming from the real world or from less abstract mathematical theories. Also many mathematical theories which had seemed to be totally pure mathematics were eventually used in applied areas mainly physics and computer science. A famous early example is Isaac Newton s demonstration that his law of universal gravitation implied that planets move in orbits that are conic sections geometrical curves that had been studied in antiquity by Apollonius. Another example is the problem of factoring large integers which is the basis of the RSA cryptosystem widely used to secure internet communications. It follows that presently the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a philosophical point of view or a mathematician s preference rather than a rigid subdivision of mathematics.

{"id": "46426065", "abstract": ["Logic is the study of correct reasoning or good arguments. It is often defined in a more narrow sense as the science of deductively valid inferences or of logical truths. In this sense it is equivalent to formal logic and constitutes a formal science investigating how conclusions follow from premises in a topic neutral way or which propositions are true only in virtue of the logical vocabulary they contain. When used as a countable noun the term a logic refers to a logical formal system. Formal logic contrasts with informal logic which is also part of logic when understood in the widest sense. There is no general agreement on how the two are to be distinguished. One prominent approach associates their difference with the study of arguments expressed in formal or informal languages. Another characterizes informal logic as the study of ampliative inferences in contrast to the deductive inferences studied by formal logic. But it is also common to link their difference to the distinction between formal and informal fallacies. Logic is based on various fundamental concepts. It studies arguments which are made up of a set of premises together with a conclusion. Premises and conclusions are usually understood either as sentences or as propositions and are characterized by their internal structure. Complex propositions are made up of other propositions linked to each other by propositional connectives. Simple propositions have subpropositional parts like singular terms and predicates. In either case the truth of a proposition usually depends on the denotations of its constituents. Logically true propositions constitute a special case since their truth depends only on the logical vocabulary used in them. The arguments or inferences made up of these propositions can be either correct or incorrect. An argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion. The strongest form of support is found in deductive arguments it is impossible for their premises to be true and their conclusion to be false. This is the case if they follow a rule of inference which ensures the truth of the conclusion if the premises are true. A consequence of this is that deductive arguments cannot arrive at any substantive new information not already found in their premises. They contrast in this respect with ampliative arguments which may provide genuinely new information. This comes with an important drawback it is possible for all their premises to be true while their conclusion is still false. Many arguments found in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative arguments. They are sometimes divided into inductive and abductive arguments. Inductive arguments usually take the form of statistical generalizations while abductive arguments are inferences to the best explanation . Arguments that fall short of the standards of correct reasoning are called fallacies. For formal fallacies the source of the error is found in the form of the argument while informal fallacies usually contain errors on the level of the content or the context . Besides the definitory rules of logic which determine whether an argument is correct or not there are also strategic rules which describe how a chain of correct arguments can be used to arrive at one s intended conclusion. In formal logic formal systems are often used to give a precise definition of correct reasoning using a formal language. Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of reasoning and arguments. Aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of syllogisms. Its traditional dominance was replaced by classical logic in the modern era. Classical logic is classical in the sense that it is based on various fundamental logical intuitions shared by most logicians. It consists of propositional logic and first order logic. Propositional logic ignores the internal structure of simple propositions and only considers the logical relations on the level of propositions. First order logic on the other hand articulates this internal structure using various linguistic devices such as predicates and quantifiers. Extended logics accept the basic intuitions behind classical logic and extend it to other fields such as metaphysics ethics and epistemology. This happens usually by introducing new logical symbols such as modal operators. Deviant logics on the other hand reject certain classical intuitions and provide alternative accounts of the fundamental laws of logic. While most systems of logic belong to formal logic some systems of informal logic have also been proposed. One prominent approach understands reasoning as a dialogical game of persuasion while another focuses on the epistemic role of arguments.

Born into an aristocratic Nawab family in Bengal in 1894 he was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University before pursuing his post graduation studies at the Cambridge University. Upon returning he emabarked on his journey as a politician on the platform of All India Muslim League. Initially his political career revolved around advocating for educational reforms and development in Bengal. However later on he started supporting the cause for a separate Muslim homeland under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He held the office of Prime Minister of Bengal from 1943 to 1945. His tenure saw the Bengal famine of 1943 which was disastrously handled by his administration. After Partition he became the first Chief Minister of East Bengal an office he held until his ascension to Governor General in 1948 following the death of Jinnah. In 1951 he relinquished the post of Governor General to Sir Ghulam Muhammad and took control of the Federal Government as Prime Minister after the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan. As a Prime Minister he struggled to run the government effectively on both the internal and foreign fronts and thus his tenure was short lived. On the home front he was unsuccessful in maintaining law and order and imposed martial law in Lahore following religious riots of 1953 and economic stagnation. He also faced a populist language movement in his native Bengal that eventually led to the shutdown of its provincial government. On the foreign front diplomatic relations with the United States Soviet Union Afghanistan and India soured as republicanism and socialism gained popularity at home. Eventually he was forced to step down in favor of diplomat Mohammad Ali Bogra by his own appointed Governor General Sir Malik Ghulam in 1953. He also conceded defeat in elections held in 1954 in Bengal. Shortly after retirement from national politics he suffered a brief illness and died in 1964.

The term is also used to describe the shape rod of certain bacteria and the plural Bacilli is the name of the class of bacteria to which this genus belongs. Bacillus species can be either obligate aerobes oxygen dependent or facultative anaerobes having the ability to continue living in the absence of oxygen. Cultured Bacillus species test positive for the enzyme catalase if oxygen has been used or is present. Bacillus can reduce themselves to oval endospores and can remain in this dormant state for years. The endospore of one species from Morocco is reported to have survived being heated to 420 C. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients the bacterium divides within its cell wall and one side then engulfs the other. They are not true spores i.e. not an offspring . Endospore formation originally defined the genus but not all such species are closely related and many species have been moved to other genera of the Bacillota . Only one endospore is formed per cell. The spores are resistant to heat cold radiation desiccation and disinfectants. Bacillus anthracis needs oxygen to sporulate this constraint has important consequences for epidemiology and control. In vivo B. anthracis produces a polypeptide polyglutamic acid capsule that kills it from phagocytosis. The genera Bacillus and Clostridium constitute the family Bacillaceae . Species are identified by using morphologic and biochemical criteria. Because the spores of many Bacillus species are resistant to heat radiation disinfectants and desiccation they are difficult to eliminate from medical and pharmaceutical materials and are a frequent cause of contamination. Not only are they resistant to heat radiation etc. but they are also resistant to chemicals such as antibiotics. This resistance allows them to survive for many years and especially in a controlled environment. Bacillus species are well known in the food industries as troublesome spoilage organisms. Ubiquitous in nature Bacillus includes symbiotic sometimes referred to as endophytes as well as independent species. Two parasitic pathogenic species are medically significant B. anthracis causes anthrax and B. cereus causes food poisoning. Many species of Bacillus can produce copious amounts of enzymes which are used in various industries such as in the production of alpha amylase used in starch hydrolysis and the protease subtilisin used in detergents. B. subtilis is a valuable model for bacterial research. Some Bacillus species can synthesize and secrete lipopeptides in particular surfactins and mycosubtilins. Bacillus species are also found in marine sponges. Marine sponge associated Bacillus subtilis strains WS1A and YBS29 can synthesize several antimicrobial peptides.

{"id": "475199", "abstract": ["In meteorology a low pressure area low area or low is a region where the atmospheric pressure is lower than that of surrounding locations. Generally A low pressure area is commonly associated with inclement weather such as cloudy windy with possible rain or storms while a high pressure area is associated with lighter winds and clear skies. Winds circle anti clockwise around lows in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere due to opposing Coriolis forces. Low pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in the upper levels of the atmosphere aloft . The formation process of a low pressure area is known as cyclogenesis. In meteorology atmospheric divergence aloft occurs in two kinds of places The first is in the area on the east side of upper troughs which form half of a Rossby wave within the Westerlies a trough with large wavelength that extends through the troposphere . A second is an area where wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave troughs which are of smaller wavelength. Diverging winds aloft ahead of these troughs cause atmospheric lift within the troposphere below as air flows upwards away from the surface which lowers surface pressures as this upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity packing the air close to the ground. Thermal lows form due to localized heating caused by greater solar incidence over deserts and other land masses. Since localized areas of warm air are less dense than their surroundings this warmer air rises which lowers atmospheric pressure near that portion of the Earth s surface. Large scale thermal lows over continents help drive monsoon circulations. Low pressure areas can also form due to organized thunderstorm activity over warm water. When this occurs over the tropics in concert with the Intertropical Convergence Zone it is known as a monsoon trough. Monsoon troughs reach their northerly extent in August and their southerly extent in February. When a convective low acquires a well hot circulation in the tropics it is termed a tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones can form during any month of the year globally but can occur in either the northern or southern hemisphere during December. Atmospheric lift will also generally produce cloud cover through adiabatic cooling once the air temperature drops below the dew point as it rises although the low pressure area typically brings cloudy skies which act to dampen diurnal temperature extremes. Since clouds reflect sunlight incoming shortwave solar radiation decreases which causes lower temperatures during the day. At night the absorptive effect of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation such as heat energy from the surface allows for warmer night time minimums in all seasons. The stronger the area of low pressure the stronger the winds experienced in its vicinity. Globally low pressure systems are most frequently located over the Tibetan Plateau and in the lee of the Rocky mountains. In Europe particularly in the British Isles and Netherlands recurring low pressure weather systems are typically known as low levels ."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Earth science", "Air"], "title": "Low-pressure area", "headers": ["Formation", "Climatology", "Associated weather", "See also", "References"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["18955999", "261273", "14531", "261690", "7783", "319671", "31776", "21148", "22217", "33125", "4689264", "8210537", "309715", "202898", "42806", "19344654", "523282", "6953458", "786501", "706884", "8282374", "23070", "26769", "2926", "239297", "37530", "15440316", "57630", "19630739", "3736", "22126", "325363", "3079", "9228", "8429", "27979", "47484", "208463", "698", "432961", "31921", "47521", "20647050", "14580", "130312", "19904"]}

The genre s greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists. The music as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre was able to appeal to artistically inclined adolescents and younger adults especially due to its virtuosity and musical lyrical complexity.

{"id": "492271", "abstract": ["Clinical psychology is an integration of science theory and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding preventing and relieving psychologically based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment clinical formulation and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists also engage in research teaching consultation forensic testimony and program development and administration. In many countries clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time three main educational models have developed in the USA the Ph.D. Clinical Science model heavily focused on research the Ph.D. science practitioner model integrating scientific research and practice and the Psy.D. practitioner scholar model focusing on clinical theory and practice . In the UK and the Republic of Ireland the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at the masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations psychodynamic humanistic cognitive behavioral therapy CBT and systems or family therapy. Clinical psychology is distinguished from psychiatry. Although practitioners in both fields are mental health professionals clinical psychologists treat mental disorders primarily through psychotherapy and have a doctorate in Psychology or a Doctor of Psychology degree. Currently five U.S. states Louisiana New Mexico Illinois Iowa and Idaho allow clinical psychologists with advanced specialty training to prescribe psychotropic medications. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who treat mental disorders primarily through medication and have a medical degree."], "label": ["Society and social sciences", "Social studies", "Psychology"], "title": "Clinical psychology", "headers": ["History", "Professional practice", "Training and certification to practice", "Assessment", "Intervention", "Professional ethics", "Comparison with other mental health professions", "Criticisms and controversies", "See also", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["18994221", "334037", "581449", "24032", "23585", "62329", "252200", "34197", "4805", "990505", "7554", "22921", "24931", "1573230", "28387", "912656", "18957", "21649", "146717", "154329", "540801", "19725260", "19013767", "70402", "7991410", "8389", "33632441", "23047", "200732", "188886", "38722", "14849", "18130", "324180", "19356", "26743", "32927", "43427", "80135", "775", "21245", "55866", "4764461", "23315", "10970082", "170346", "19446", "418101", "13311819", "14892", "21073209", "26810748", "25524", "5135982", "16462572", "180121", "21226", "21031297", "3717", "31793", "31717", "5961", "18973869", "14607"]}

Turner first exhibited at The Royal Academy of Arts in 1840. Measuring in oil on canvas it is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. In this classic example of a Romantic maritime painting Turner depicts a ship visible in the background sailing through a tumultuous sea of churning water and leaving scattered human forms floating in its wake. Turner was possibly moved to paint The Slave Ship after reading about the slave ship Zong in The History and Abolition of the Slave Trade by Thomas Clarkson the second edition of which was published in 1839. The initial exhibition of the painting in 1840 coincided with international abolitionist campaigns. As the piece changed hands in subsequent years it was subject to a wide array of conflicting interpretations.

{"id": "51039", "abstract": ["Robert Dudley 1st Earl of Leicester 24 June 1532 4 September 1588 was an English statesman and the favourite of Elizabeth I from her accession until his death. He was a suitor for the Queen s hand for many years. Dudley s youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father The 1st Duke of Northumberland had failed to prevent the accession of Mary I. Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the Battle of St. Quentin under Mary s husband and co ruler Philip which led to his full rehabilitation. On Elizabeth I s accession in November 1558 Dudley was appointed Master of the Horse. In October 1562 he became a Privy Councillor and in 1587 was appointed Lord Steward of the Royal Household. In 1564 Dudley became Earl of Leicester and from 1563 one of the greatest landowners in North Wales and the English West Midlands by royal grants. The Earl of Leicester was one of Elizabeth s leading statesmen involved in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside William Cecil and Sir Francis Walsingham. Although he refused to be married to Mary Queen of Scots Lord Leicester was for a long time relatively sympathetic to her until from the mid 1580s he strongly advocated for her execution. As patron of the Puritan movement he supported non conforming preachers but tried to mediate between them and the bishops of the Church of England. A champion also of the international Protestant cause he led the English campaign in support of the Dutch Revolt 1585 87 . His acceptance of the post of Governor General of the United Provinces infuriated Queen Elizabeth. The expedition was a military and political failure and it ruined the Earl financially. Leicester was engaged in many large scale business ventures and was one of the main backers of Francis Drake and other explorers and privateers. During the Spanish Armada the Earl was in overall command of the English land forces. In this function he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at Tilbury. This was the last of many events he had organised over the years the most spectacular being the festival at his seat Kenilworth Castle in 1575 on occasion of a three week visit by the Queen. Lord Leicester was a principal patron of the arts literature and the Elizabethan theatre. Lord Leicester s private life interfered with his court career and vice versa . When his first wife Amy Robsart fell down a flight of stairs and died in 1560 he was free to marry the Queen. However the resulting scandal very much reduced his chances in this respect. Popular rumours that he had arranged for his wife s death continued throughout his life despite the coroner s jury s verdict of accident. For 18 years he did not remarry for Queen Elizabeth s sake and when he finally did his new wife Lettice Knollys was permanently banished from court. This and the death of his only legitimate son and heir were heavy blows. Shortly after the child s death in 1584 a virulent libel known as Leicester s Commonwealth was circulated in England. It laid the foundation of a literary and historiographical tradition that often depicted the Earl as the Machiavellian master courtier and as a deplorable figure around Elizabeth I.

President Harry S. Truman had created the Central Intelligence Group under the direction of a Director of Central Intelligence by presidential directive on January 22 1946 and this group was transformed into the Central Intelligence Agency by implementation of the National Security Act of 1947.

The CIA serves as the national manager for the coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community. It is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President. It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions such as the Special Activities Center. The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries such as Germany s BND. It has also provided support to many foreign political groups and governments including planning coordinating training in torture and technical support. It was involved in carrying out several regime changes terrorist attacks and planned assassinations of foreign leaders.

Together a specification of all of the quantum numbers of a quantum system fully characterize a basis state of the system and can in principle be measured together. An important aspect of quantum mechanics is the quantization of many observable quantities of interest. In particular this leads to quantum numbers that take values in discrete sets of integers or half integers although they could approach infinity in some cases. This distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics where the values that characterize the system such as mass charge or momentum all range continuously. Quantum numbers often describe specifically the energy levels of electrons in atoms but other possibilities include angular momentum spin etc. An important family is flavour quantum numbers internal quantum numbers which determine the type of a particle and its interactions with other particles through the fundamental forces.

Vizzini was considered to be one of the most influential and legendary Mafia bosses of Sicily after World War II until his death in 1954. In the media he was often depicted as the boss of bosses although such a position does not exist in the loose structure of Cosa Nostra. He was the archetype of the paternalistic man of honour of a rural Mafia that disappeared in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the first stage of his career he used violence to establish his position but in the second phase he limited recourse to violence turned to principally legal sources of income and exercised his power in an open and legitimate manner. Vizzini is the central character in the history of direct Mafia support for the Allied Forces during the invasion of Sicily in 1943. After World War II he became the personification of the re instatement of Cosa Nostra during the Allied occupation and the subsequent restoration of democracy after the repression under Fascist rule. Initially he supported the separatist movement but changed allegiance to the Christian Democrat party when it became clear that Sicilian independence was unfeasible. When he died in 1954 thousands of peasants dressed in black and high ranking mafiosi politicians and priests took part in his funeral. The funeral epitaph stated that his mafia was not criminal but stood for respect of the law defense of all rights greatness of character. It was love .

{"id": "5378", "abstract": ["Physical cosmology is a branch of cosmology concerned with the study of cosmological models. A cosmological model or simply cosmology provides a description of the largest scale structures and dynamics of the universe and allows study of fundamental questions about its origin structure evolution and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth and Newtonian mechanics which first allowed those physical laws to be understood. Physical cosmology as it is now understood began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein s general theory of relativity followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s first Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond the Milky Way then work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang theory by Georges Lema\u00eetre as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies however most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory best explains the observations. Dramatic advances in observational cosmology since the 1990s including the cosmic microwave background distant supernovae and galaxy redshift surveys have led to the development of a standard model of cosmology. This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose nature is currently not well understood but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations. Cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of research in theoretical and applied physics.

This claim was renounced under the 1983 treaty of friendship between Tuvalu and the United States. In 1974 the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu separating from the Gilbert Islands which became Kiribati upon independence.

Coca was also nominated for a Tony Award in 1978 for On the Twentieth Century and received a sixth Emmy nomination at the age of 80 for an episode of Moonlighting . She possessed a rubbery face capable of the broadest expressions Life magazine compared her to Beatrice Lillie and Charlie Chaplin and described her characterizations as taking people or situations suspended in their own precarious balance between dignity and absurdity and push ing them over the cliff with one single pointed gesture . The magazine noted a particularly high brow critic as observing The trouble with most comedians who try to do satire is that they are essentially brash noisy and indelicate people who have to use a sledge hammer to smash a butterfly. Miss Coca on the other hand is the timid woman who when aroused can beat a tiger to death with a feather.

{"id": "636094", "abstract": ["In science a process that is not reversible is called irreversible . This concept arises frequently in thermodynamics. All complex natural processes are irreversible although a phase transition at the coexistence temperature e.g. melting of ice cubes in water is well approximated as reversible. In thermodynamics a change in the thermodynamic state of a system and all of its surroundings cannot be precisely restored to its initial state by infinitesimal changes in some property of the system without expenditure of energy. A system that undergoes an irreversible process may still be capable of returning to its initial state. Because entropy is a state function the change in entropy of the system is the same whether the process is reversible or irreversible. However the impossibility occurs in restoring the environment to its own initial conditions. An irreversible process increases the total entropy of the system and its surroundings. The second law of thermodynamics can be used to determine whether a hypothetical process is reversible or not. Intuitively a process is reversible if there is no dissipation. For example Joule expansion is irreversible because initially the system is not uniform. Initially there is part of the system with gas in it and part of the system with no gas. For dissipation to occur there needs to be such a non uniformity. This is just the same as if in a system one section of the gas was hot and the other cold. Then dissipation would occur the temperature distribution would become uniform with no work being done and this would be irreversible because you couldn t add or remove heat or change the volume to return the system to its initial state. Thus if the system is always uniform then the process is reversible meaning that you can return the system to its original state by either adding or removing heat doing work on the system or letting the system do work. As another example to approximate the expansion in an internal combustion engine as reversible we would be assuming that the temperature and pressure uniformly change throughout the volume after the spark. Obviously this is not true and there is a flame front and sometimes even engine knocking. One of the reasons that Diesel engines are able to attain higher efficiency is that the combustion is much more uniform so less energy is lost to dissipation and the process is closer to reversible. The phenomenon of irreversibility results from the fact that if a thermodynamic system which is any system of sufficient complexity of interacting molecules is brought from one thermodynamic state to another the configuration or arrangement of the atoms and molecules in the system will change in a way that is not easily predictable. Some transformation energy will be used as the molecules of the working body do work on each other when they change from one state to another. During this transformation there will be some heat energy loss or dissipation due to intermolecular friction and collisions. This energy will not be recoverable if the process is reversed. Many biological processes that were once thought to be reversible have been found to actually be a pairing of two irreversible processes. Whereas a single enzyme was once believed to catalyze both the forward and reverse chemical changes research has found that two separate enzymes of similar structure are typically needed to perform what results in a pair of thermodynamically irreversible processes."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Physics", "Thermodynamics"], "title": "Irreversible process", "headers": ["Absolute versus statistical reversibility", "History", "Examples of irreversible processes", "Complex systems", "See also", "References"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["184726", "16413778", "133017", "1240378", "9328562", "31883", "33302", "175146", "54423", "9127632", "29952", "238560", "18413531", "8221", "9891", "11062", "544255", "160990", "2747182", "28989696", "2684988", "416681", "237876", "37438", "425850", "6295", "48740"]}

It is loosely adapted from the novel Les amours du chevalier de Faublas by Louvet de Couvrai and Moli\u00e8re s comedy Monsieur de Pourceaugnac . It was first performed at the K\u00f6nigliches Opernhaus in Dresden on 26 January 1911 under the direction of Max Reinhardt Ernst von Schuch conducting. Until the premiere the working title was Ochs auf Lerchenau . The choice of the name Ochs is not accidental for in German Ochs means ox which describes the character of the Baron throughout the opera. The opera has four main characters the aristocratic Marschallin her very young lover Count Octavian Rofrano her brutish cousin Baron Ochs and Ochs prospective fianc\u00e9e Sophie von Faninal the daughter of a rich bourgeois. At the Marschallin s suggestion Octavian acts as Ochs Rosenkavalier by presenting a ceremonial silver rose to Sophie. However the young people fall in love on the spot and soon devise a comic intrigue to extricate Sophie from her engagement. They accomplish this with help from the Marschallin who then yields Octavian to the younger woman. Though a comic opera the work incorporates some weighty themes particularly through the Marschallin s character arc including infidelity aging sexual predation and selflessness in love or the lack thereof . Der Rosenkavalier is notable for its showcasing of the female voice as its protagonists light lyric soprano Sophie mezzo soprano Octavian and the mature dramatic soprano Marschallin are written to be portrayed by women who share several duets as well as a trio at the opera s emotional climax.

Shaktism is known for its various sub traditions of Tantra as well as a galaxy of goddesses with respective systems. It consists of the Vidyapitha and Kulam rga. The pantheon of goddesses in Shaktism grew after the decline of Buddhism in India wherein Hindu and Buddhist goddesses were combined to form the Mahavidya a list of ten goddesses. The most common aspects of Devi found in Shaktism include Durga Kali Saraswati Lakshmi Parvati and Tripurasundari. The Goddess focused tradition is very popular in Northeastern India particularly West Bengal Odisha Bihar Jharkhand Tripura and Assam which it celebrates festivals such as the Durga puja which is popular in West Bengal and Odisha. Shaktism also emphasizes that intense love of deity is more important than simple obedience thus showing the influence of Vaishnava idea where passionate relationship between Radha and Krishna is also the ideal relationship.

The main combatants were Azerbaijan with support from Turkey and foreign mercenary groups on one side and the self proclaimed Republic of Artsakh and Armenia on the other. It was the latest escalation of an unresolved conflict over the region which was annexed to Azerbaijan during the Soviet era and internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but partially governed by Artsakh a breakaway state with an Armenian ethnic majority. The fighting began on the morning of 27 September 2020 with an Azerbaijani offensive along the Nagorno Karabakh Line of Contact established in the aftermath of the First Nagorno Karabakh War 1988 1994 with the primary goal of reclaiming the less mountainous districts of southern Nagorno Karabakh which were easier to take than the region s well fortified interior. In response Armenia and Artsakh introduced martial law and total mobilisation while Azerbaijan introduced martial law a curfew and partial mobilisation. Turkey provided military support to Azerbaijan although the extent of this support has been disputed. Turkey s involvement is thought to have been an attempt to extend its sphere of influence both by giving Azerbaijan the upper hand in the conflict and by marginalising Russia s influence over the region. The war was marked by the deployment of drones sensors long range heavy artillery and missile strikes as well as by state propaganda and the use of official social media accounts in online information warfare. In particular Azerbaijan s widespread use of drones was seen as crucial in determining the conflict s outcome. Numerous countries and the United Nations strongly condemned the fighting and called on both sides to de escalate tensions and resume meaningful negotiations without delay. Three ceasefires brokered by Russia France and the United States failed to stop the conflict. Following the capture of Shusha the second largest city in Nagorno Karabakh a ceasefire agreement was signed between the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev the Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin ending all hostilities in the area from 10 November 2020. The President of Artsakh Arayik Harutyunyan also agreed to end hostilities. Under the agreement the warring sides kept control of the areas they held within Nagorno Karabakh at the time of the ceasefire while Armenia returned the surrounding territories it had occupied since 1994 to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan will also gain transport communication to its Nakhchivan exclave bordering Turkey and Iran. Approximately 2 000 Russian soldiers have been deployed as peacekeeping forces along the Lachin corridor connecting Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh with a mandate of at least five years. Following the end of the war an unconfirmed number of Armenian prisoners of war were captive in Azerbaijan with reports of mistreatment.

{"id": "658141", "abstract": ["Peridotite is a dense coarse grained igneous rock consisting mostly of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Peridotite is ultramafic as the rock contains less than 45 silica. It is high in magnesium Mg2 reflecting the high proportions of magnesium rich olivine with appreciable iron. Peridotite is derived from Earth s mantle either as solid blocks and fragments or as crystals accumulated from magmas that formed in the mantle. The compositions of peridotites from these layered igneous complexes vary widely reflecting the relative proportions of pyroxenes chromite plagioclase and amphibole. Peridotite is the dominant rock of the upper part of Earth s mantle. The compositions of peridotite nodules found in certain basalts and diamond pipes kimberlites are of special interest because they provide samples of Earth s mantle brought up from depths ranging from about 30 km to 200 km or more. Some of the nodules preserve isotope ratios of osmium and other elements that record processes that occurred when Earth was formed and so they are of special interest to paleogeologists because they provide clues to the early composition of Earth s mantle and the complexities of the processes that occurred. The word peridotite comes from the gemstone peridot which consists of pale green olivine. Classic peridotite is bright green with some specks of black although most hand samples tend to be darker green. Peridotitic outcrops typically range from earthy bright yellow to dark green this is because olivine is easily weathered to iddingsite.

Electronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital in an average field created by all other orbitals. Mathematically configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions. According to the laws of quantum mechanics for systems with only one electron a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration and in certain conditions electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy in the form of a photon. Knowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements.

{"id": "68300", "abstract": ["In genetics dominance is the phenomenon of one variant allele of a gene on a chromosome masking or overriding the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome. The first variant is termed dominant and the second recessive . This state of having two different variants of the same gene on each chromosome is originally caused by a mutation in one of the genes either new de novo or inherited. The terms autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive are used to describe gene variants on non sex chromosomes autosomes and their associated traits while those on sex chromosomes allosomes are termed X linked dominant X linked recessive or Y linked these have an inheritance and presentation pattern that depends on the sex of botthe parent and the child see Sex linkage . Since there is only one copy of the Y chromosome Y linked traits cannot be dominant or recessive. Additionally there are other forms of dominance such as incomplete dominance in which a gene variant has a partial effect compared to when it is present on both chromosomes and co dominance in which different variants on each chromosome both show their associated traits. Dominance is not inherent to an allele or its traits phenotype . It is a strictly relative effect between two alleles of a given gene of any function one allele can be dominant over a second allele of the same gene recessive to a third and co dominant with a fourth. Additionally one allele may be dominant for one trait but not others. Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics. Letters and Punnett squares are used to demonstrate the principles of dominance in teaching and the use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case letters for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention. A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape in peas. Peas may be round associated with allele R or wrinkled associated with allele r . In this case three combinations of alleles genotypes are possible RR Rr and rr . The RR homozygous individuals have round peas and the rr homozygous individuals have wrinkled peas. In Rr heterozygous individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele so these individuals also have round peas. Thus allele R is dominant over allele r and allele r is recessive to allele R . Dominance differs from epistasis the phenomenon of an allele of one gene masking the effect of alleles of a different gene."], "label": ["Biological and health sciences", "Biology", "Genetics"], "title": "Dominance (genetics)", "headers": ["Background", "Types of Dominance", "Nomenclature", "Relationship to other genetic concepts", "Molecular mechanisms", "Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans", "See also", "References", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["9257", "23661260", "21304415", "18630637", "1420406", "2457", "23634", "18567040", "21147", "1586721", "59407", "230319", "2324040", "18838", "7251", "12437", "164912", "6438", "55309", "41244", "297382", "19702", "83537", "38001", "4250553", "21505", "76099", "68206", "13457", "25758", "1911", "37694", "12295", "13483", "24543", "12796", "19595", "50513", "89796", "34441", "7955", "18976", "12266", "68300", "49414", "276106", "140824"]}

As Hamiltonian mechanics are generalized by symplectic geometry and canonical transformations are generalized by contact transformations so the 19th century definition of canonical coordinates in classical mechanics may be generalized to a more abstract 20th century definition of coordinates on the cotangent bundle of a manifold the mathematical notion of phase space ."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Physics", "Mechanics"], "title": "Canonical coordinates", "headers": ["Definition in classical mechanics", "Definition on cotangent bundles", "Formal development", "Generalized coordinates", "See also", "References"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["23371726", "191101", "19555586", "198319", "20431", "62641", "18831", "2073470", "25202"]}
{"id": "70807", "abstract": ["A thunderstorm also known as an electrical storm or a lightning storm is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth s atmosphere known as thunder. Relatively weak thunderstorms are sometimes called thundershowers . Thunderstorms occur in a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds and often produce heavy rain and sometimes snow sleet or hail but some thunderstorms produce little precipitation or no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena including large hail strong winds and tornadoes. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms known as supercells rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction. Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm moist air sometimes along a front. However some kind of cloud forcing whether it is a front shortwave trough or another system is needed for the air to rapidly accelerate upward. As the warm moist air moves upward it cools condenses and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth s surface. As the droplets fall they collide with other droplets and become larger. The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it and this cold air spreads out at the Earth s surface occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms. Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid latitude where warm moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms and the phenomena that occur along with them pose great hazards. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds large hailstones and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts. There are three types of thunderstorms single cell multi cell and supercell. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms with no precipitation can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud to ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms weather radar weather stations and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century.

For example if we know that the remainder of n divided by 3 is 2 the remainder of n divided by 5 is 3 and the remainder of n divided by 7 is 2 then without knowing the value of n we can determine that the remainder of n divided by 105 the product of 3 5 and 7 is 23. Importantly this tells us that if n is a natural number less than 105 then 23 is the only possible value of n . The earliest known statement of the theorem is by the Chinese mathematician Sun tzu in the Sun tzu Suan ching in the 3rd century CE. The Chinese remainder theorem is widely used for computing with large integers as it allows replacing a computation for which one knows a bound on the size of the result by several similar computations on small integers.

{"id": "7738", "abstract": ["Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine concerned with the diagnosis treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system especially of the spine. It has esoteric origins and is based on several pseudoscientific ideas. Many chiropractors especially those in the field s early history have proposed that mechanical disorders of the joints especially of the spine affect general health and that regular manipulation of the spine spinal adjustment improves general health. The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy especially manipulation of the spine other joints and soft tissues but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling. A chiropractor may have a Doctor of Chiropractic D.C. degree and be referred to as doctor but is not a Doctor of Medicine M.D. While many chiropractors view themselves as primary care providers chiropractic clinical training does not meet the requirements to be such a provider. Systematic reviews of controlled clinical studies of treatments used by chiropractors have found no evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective with the possible exception of treatment for back pain. A 2011 critical evaluation of 45 systematic reviews found that spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition. Spinal manipulation may be cost effective for sub acute or chronic low back pain but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient. No compelling evidence exists to indicate that maintenance chiropractic care adequately prevents symptoms or diseases. There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of chiropractic manipulations. It is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects with serious or fatal complications in rare cases. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of vertebral artery dissection which can lead to stroke and death from cervical manipulation. Several deaths have been associated with this technique and it has been suggested that the relationship is causative a claim which is disputed by many chiropractors. Chiropractic is well established in the United States Canada and Australia. It overlaps with other manual therapy professions such as osteopathy and physical therapy. Most who seek chiropractic care do so for low back pain. Back and neck pain are considered the specialties of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues. Chiropractic has two main groups straights now the minority emphasize vitalism Innate Intelligence and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease and mixers the majority are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques such as exercise massage and ice therapy. D. D. Palmer founded chiropractic in the 1890s after saying he received it from the other world Palmer maintained that the tenets of chiropractic were passed along to him by a doctor who had died 50 years previously. His son B. J. Palmer helped to expand chiropractic in the early 20th century. Throughout its history chiropractic has been controversial. Its foundation is at odds with evidence based medicine and has been sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as vertebral subluxation and innate intelligence. Despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is an effective public health intervention among chiropractors there are significant disagreements over the subject which has led to negative impacts on both public vaccination and mainstream acceptance of chiropractic. The American Medical Association called chiropractic an unscientific cult in 1966 and boycotted it until losing an antitrust case in 1987. Chiropractic has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services. In the last decades of the twentieth century it gained more legitimacy and greater acceptance among conventional physicians and health plans in the United States.

{"id": "7819", "abstract": ["A cactus plural cacti cactuses or less commonly cactus is a member of the plant family Cactaceae a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales. The word cactus derives through Latin from the Ancient Greek word k\u00e1ktos a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Although some species live in quite humid environments most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments even being found in the Atacama Desert one of the driest places on Earth. Because of this cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. For example almost all cacti are succulents meaning they have thickened fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves retaining only spines which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of true leaves cacti s enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to the Americas ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north except for Rhipsalis baccifera which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka. Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines areoles give rise to flowers which are usually tubular and multipetaled. Many cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies and are able to react quickly to any rainfall helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain followed by retention over long drought periods. Like other succulent plants most cacti employ a special mechanism called crassulacean acid metabolism CAM as part of photosynthesis. Transpiration during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid retaining it until daylight returns and only then using it in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place during the cooler more humid night hours water loss is significantly reduced. Many smaller cacti have globe shaped stems combining the highest possible volume for water storage with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration. The tallest free standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei with a maximum recorded height of and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana only about in diameter at maturity. A fully grown saguaro Carnegiea gigantea is said to be able to absorb as much as of water during a rainstorm. A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family. At least superficially plants of the genera Leuenbergeria Rhodocactus and Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them. They have persistent leaves and when older bark covered stems. Their areoles identify them as cacti and in spite of their appearance they too have many adaptations for water conservation. Leuenbergeria is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved. In tropical regions other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes plants that grow on trees . Their stems are typically flattened almost leaf like in appearance with fewer or even no spines such as the well known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus in the genus Schlumbergera . Cacti have a variety of uses many species are used as ornamental plants others are grown for fodder or forage and others for food particularly their fruit . Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti. Many succulent plants in both the Old and New World such as some Euphorbiaceae euphorbias are also spiny stem succulents and because of this are sometimes incorrectly referred to as cactus ."], "label": ["Biological and health sciences", "Plants", "Plants"], "title": "Cactus", "headers": ["Morphology", "Adaptations for water conservation", "Taxonomy and classification", "Phylogeny and evolution", "Distribution", "Reproductive ecology", "Uses", "Conservation", "Cultivation", "Notes", "References", "Bibliography", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["9257", "19011", "167906", "309715", "21883824", "18987", "233609", "169493", "14080493", "85746", "2394288", "26769", "21139", "5042916", "358", "29833", "10843", "22286", "23649300", "395286", "29988", "143913", "3392", "809539", "82804", "1354", "13607", "171118", "32347", "6201", "42052", "439973", "148363", "5489", "230909", "18952693", "23538713", "18952324", "4654", "27642638", "152776", "37694", "4576465", "5906", "23291", "170691", "6985", "18619339", "496667", "65433", "18947686", "170396", "6121", "3410", "18952357", "432138", "14653", "56333", "98409", "2594", "21649", "834586", "230364", "6355", "593231", "26197", "5334607", "47858", "18952869", "18952860", "69427", "3462", "371272", "201943", "7607314", "40814", "54969", "18973622", "606848", "2393552", "243074", "7934681", "5233", "18952520", "44568", "18952853", "5932", "9419", "61708", "186729", "4689264", "13270", "5407", "18952975", "193031", "23672633", "211505", "27619", "673275", "24544", "31665644", "33632441", "3383", "19389113", "2774053", "227682", "18951905", "18964", "3966054", "70649", "53198", "14533", "717", "19828134", "102871", "26750", "2049869", "37335"]}

Matthias Jabs joined in 1978 and with the melodic rock he played and the influence of producer Dieter Dierks in the band the Scorpions changed their sound to melodic heavy metal mixed with lyrical power rock ballads which is evident in the album Lovedrive 1979 which began the evolution of the band s sound developed later in several of their albums. Over the next decade the band achieved influence approval from music critics and significant commercial success with the albums Animal Magnetism 1980 Blackout 1982 Love at First Sting 1984 the live recording World Wide Live 1985 Savage Amusement 1988 their best selling compilation Best of Rockers n Ballads 1989 and Crazy World 1990 all awarded at least one platinum award in the United States. The band has released thirteen consecutive studio albums that were in the top 10 in Germany one of which reached No. 1 as well as three consecutive albums that were in the top 10 in the Billboard 200 in the United States. Their latest studio album Rock Believer was released in February 2022. Scorpions are estimated to have sold over 100 million records around the world making them one of the best selling hard rock and heavy metal bands. One of their most recognized hits is Wind of Change from Crazy World a symbolic anthem of the political changes in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall and it remains as one of the best selling singles in the world with over 14 million copies. Two of the songs on their ninth studio album Love at First Sting Rock You Like a Hurricane and Still Loving You are regarded as some of the most influential and popular works both in heavy metal music and among rock ballads defined as rock anthem and a true hymn of love ."], "label": ["People", "Artists, musicians, and composers", "Musicians and composers"], "title": "Scorpions (band)", "headers": ["History", "Legacy", "Band members", "Awards and honours", "Discography", "Tours", "See also", "References", "Bibliography", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["36517", "149116", "2773076", "18309966", "20907", "4584893", "26779", "18787", "173825", "174857", "168877", "171948", "19948", "46443001", "20979", "3343", "18841893", "33166", "325329", "14197", "3524766", "381075", "3722", "18856", "25423", "24320051", "20148343", "149435", "3162905", "13869", "62750956", "32817", "23221", "25441", "19364", "20653", "124802", "23454335", "18110"]}

{"id": "8103", "abstract": ["Deforestation or forest clearance is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land that is then converted to non forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms ranches or urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. About 31 of Earth s land surface is covered by forests at present. This is one third less than the forest cover before the expansion of agriculture a half of that loss occurring in the last century. Between 15 million to 18 million hectares of forest an area the size of Bangladesh are destroyed every year. On average 2 400 trees are cut down each minute. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines deforestation as the conversion of forest to other land uses regardless of whether it is human induced . Deforestation and forest area net change are not the same the latter is the sum of all forest losses deforestation and all forest gains forest expansion in a given period. Net change therefore can be positive or negative depending on whether gains exceed losses or vice versa. The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage biodiversity loss and aridity. Deforestation causes extinction changes to climatic conditions desertification and displacement of populations as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record. Deforestation also reduces biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide increasing negative feedback cycles contributing to global warming. Global warming also puts increased pressure on communities who seek food security by clearing forests for agricultural use and reducing arable land more generally. Deforested regions typically incur significant other environmental effects such as adverse soil erosion and degradation into wasteland. The resilience of human food systems and their capacity to adapt to future change is linked to biodiversity including dryland adapted shrub and tree species that help combat desertification forest dwelling insects bats and bird species that pollinate crops trees with extensive root systems in mountain ecosystems that prevent soil erosion and mangrove species that provide resilience against flooding in coastal areas.

{"id": "8389", "abstract": ["Major depressive disorder MDD also known simply as depression is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive low mood low self esteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. Those affected may also occasionally have delusions or hallucinations. Introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid 1970s the term was adopted by the American Psychiatric Association for this symptom cluster under mood disorders in the 1980 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM III and has become widely used since. The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person s reported experiences and a mental status examination. There is no laboratory test for the disorder but testing may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. The most common time of onset is in a person s 20s with females affected about twice as often as males. The course of the disorder varies widely from one episode lasting months to a lifelong disorder with recurrent major depressive episodes. Those with major depressive disorder are typically treated with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Medication appears to be effective but the effect may only be significant in the most severely depressed. Hospitalization which may be involuntary may be necessary in cases with associated self neglect or a significant risk of harm to self or others. Electroconvulsive therapy ECT may be considered if other measures are not effective. Major depressive disorder is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic environmental and psychological factors with about 40 of the risk being genetic. Risk factors include a family history of the condition major life changes certain medications chronic health problems and substance use disorders. It can negatively affect a person s personal life work life or education as well as sleeping eating habits and general health. Major depressive disorder affected approximately 163 million people 2 of the world s population in 2017. The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7 in Japan to 21 in France. Lifetime rates are higher in the developed world 15 compared to the developing world 11 .

Red and blue are the colours of its flag. Ticino is the southernmost canton of Switzerland. It is one of the three large southern Alpine cantons along with Valais and the Grisons. However unlike all other cantons it lies almost entirely south of the Alps and has no natural access to the Swiss Plateau. Through the main crest of the Gotthard and adjacent mountain ranges it borders the canton of Valais to the northwest the canton of Uri to the north and the canton of Grisons to the northeast the latter canton being also the only one to share some borders with Ticino at the level of the plains. The canton shares international borders with Italy as well including a small Italian enclave. Named after the Ticino its longest river it is the only canton where Italian is the sole official language and represents the bulk of the Italian speaking area of Switzerland along with the southern parts of the Grisons. In Ticino had a population of . The largest city is Lugano and the two other notable centres are Bellinzona and Locarno. While the geography of the Sopraceneri region is marked by the High Alps and Lake Maggiore that of the Sottoceneri is marked by the Alpine foothills and Lake Lugano. The canton which has become one of the major tourist destinations of Switzerland distinguishes itself from the rest of the country by its warm climate and its meridional culture and gastronomy. The land now occupied by the canton was annexed from Italian cities in the 15th century by various Swiss forces in the last transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy. In the Helvetic Republic established 1798 it was divided between the two new cantons of Bellinzona and Lugano. The creation of the Swiss Confederation in 1803 saw these two cantons combine to form the modern canton of Ticino. Because of its unusual position the canton relies on important infrastructures for connections with the rest of the country.

He was the second of eight children born to emancipated slaves and raised Catholic in extreme poverty in Louisiana. Seymour was a student of the early Pentecostal minister Charles Parham and he adopted Parham s belief that speaking in tongues was the sign of receiving the baptism in the Holy Spirit. In 1906 Seymour moved to Los Angeles California where he preached the Pentecostal message and sparked the Azusa Street Revival. The revival drew large crowds of believers as well as media coverage that focused on the controversial religious practices as well as the racially integrated worship services which violated the racial norms of the time. Seymour s leadership of the revival and publication of The Apostolic Faith newspaper launched him into prominence within the young Pentecostal movement. Seymour broke with Parham in 1906 over theological differences as well as Parham s unhappiness with interracial revival meetings. As the revival s influence extended beyond Los Angeles through evangelism and missionary work Seymour was in the process of developing the revival into a larger organization called the Apostolic Faith Movement. This process was ultimately defeated by power struggles with other ministers such as Florence Crawford and William Howard Durham which ultimately damaged the unity of the early Pentecostal movement and led to a decrease in Seymour s influence. By 1914 the revival was past its peak but Seymour continued to pastor the Apostolic Faith Mission he founded until his death. The revival acted as a catalyst for the spread of Pentecostal practices such as speaking in tongues and integrated worship throughout the world.

Common symptoms include fever sore throat red tonsils tonsilitis and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A headache and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days. Strep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by touching something that has droplets on it and then touching the mouth nose or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made based on the results of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms. Prevention is by washing hands and not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with antibiotics is only recommended in those with a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people until fever is gone and for at least 12 hours after starting treatment.

{"id": "933980", "abstract": ["The tricorne or tricorn is a style of hat that was popular during the 18th century falling out of style by 1800 though actually not called a tricorne until the mid 19th century. During the 18th century hats of this general style were referred to as cocked hats . At the peak of its popularity the tricorne varied greatly in style and size and was worn not only by the aristocracy but also as common civilian dress and as part of military and naval uniforms. Typically made from animal fiber the more expensive being of beaver hair felt and the less expensive of wool felt the hat s most distinguishing characteristic was that three sides of the brim were turned up cocked and either pinned laced or buttoned in place to form a triangle around the crown. The style served two purposes first it allowed stylish gentlemen to show off the most current fashions of their wigs and thus their social status and secondly the cocked hat with its folded brim was much smaller than other hats and therefore could be more easily tucked under an arm when going inside a building where social etiquette dictates that a gentleman should remove his hat. Tricornes with laced sides could have the laces loosened and the sides dropped down to provide better protection from the weather sun and rain. Tricornes had a rather broad brim pinned up on either side of the head and at the back producing a triangular shape. The hat was typically worn with one point facing forward though it was not at all unusual for soldiers who would often rest a rifle or musket on their left shoulder to wear the tricorne pointed above their left eyebrow to allow better clearance. The crown is low unlike the steeple hats worn by the Puritans or the top hat of the 19th century. Tricornes ranged from the very simple and cheap to the extravagant occasionally incorporating gold or silver lace trimming and feathers. In addition military and naval versions usually bore a cockade or other national emblem at the front.

{"id": "960596", "abstract": ["Messier 22 or M22 also known as NGC 6656 is an elliptical globular cluster of stars in the constellation Sagittarius near the Galactic bulge region. It is one of the brightest globulars visible in the night sky. The brightest stars are 11th magnitude with hundreds of stars bright enough to resolve with an 8 telescope. It is just south of the sun s position in mid December and northwest of Lambda Sagittarii Kaus Borealis the northernmost star of the Teapot asterism. M22 was one of the first globulars to be discovered in 1665 by Abraham Ihle and it was included in Charles Messier s catalog of comet like objects in 1764. It was one of the first globular clusters to be carefully studied first by Harlow Shapley in 1930. He placed within it roughly 70 000 stars and found it had a dense core. Then Halton Arp and William G. Melbourne continued studies in 1959. Due to the large color spread of its red giant branch RGB sequence akin to that in Omega Centauri it became the object of intense scrutiny starting in 1977 with James E. Hesser et al. M22 is one of the nearer globular clusters to Earth at about 10 600 light years away. It spans 32 on the sky which means its diameter width across is 99 9 light years given its estimated distance. 32 variable stars have been recorded in M22. It is in front of part of the galactic bulge and is therefore useful for its microlensing effect on those background stars. Despite its relative proximity to us this metal poor cluster s light is limited by dust extinction giving it an apparent magnitude of 5.5 making it the brightest globular cluster visible from mid northern latitudes such as Japan Korea Europe and most of North America . From those latitudes due to its declination of nearly 24 south of the celestial equator its daily path is low in the southern sky. It thus appears less impressive to people in the temperate northern hemisphere than counterparts fairly near in angle best viewed in the Summer night sky such as M13 and M5. M22 is one of only four globulars of our galaxy known to contain a planetary nebula an expanding glowing gas swell from a massive star often a red giant . It was an object first noted of interest using the IRAS satellite by Fred Gillett and his associates in 1986 as a pointlike light source and its nature was found in 1989 by Gillett et al. The planetary nebula s central star is a blue star. The nebula designated GJJC1 is likely about only 6 000 years old. Two black holes of between 10 and 20 solar masses each were unearthed with the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico and corroborated by the Chandra X ray telescope in 2012. These imply that gravitational ejection of black holes from clusters is not as efficient as was previously thought and leads to estimates of a total 5 to 100 black holes within M22. Interactions between stars and black holes could explain the unusually large core of the cluster."], "label": ["Physical sciences", "Astronomy", "Astronomical objects"], "title": "Messier 22", "headers": ["Gallery", "See also", "Footnotes and references", "External links"], "outcoming_links_filtered": ["28927", "26808", "7246", "301728", "20608", "217873", "9264", "1028265", "21649", "1067830", "26932", "4650", "5962", "23473595", "39674", "958996", "3079", "9228", "420275", "56590", "63025", "5267", "12866", "18717261", "14775", "914432"]}

Den Uyl studied Economics at the University of Amsterdam obtaining a Master of Economics degree and worked as a civil servant at the Ministry of Economic Affairs from February 1942 until May 1945 and as a journalist and editor for Het Parool and Vrij Nederland from May 1945 until January 1949. Den Uyl served as director of the Wiardi Beckman Foundation from January 1949 until June 1963. Den Uyl became a Member of the House of Representatives shortly after the number of seats was raised from 100 to 150 seats following the election of 1956 serving from 6 November 1956 until 5 June 1963 as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Economics. Den Uyl was appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs in the Cals Cabinet taking office on 14 April 1965. After Labour Leader Anne Vondeling unexpectedly announced he was stepping down Den Uyl announced his candidacy and was selected as his successor as Leader on 13 September 1966. In the election of 1967 Den Uyl served as Lijsttrekker top candidate and became Parliamentary leader taking office on 23 February 1967. In the election of 1972 Den Uyl again served as Lijsttrekker and after a long cabinet formation formed the Den Uyl Cabinet and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office on 11 May 1973. The Cabinet collapsed on 22 March 1977 following years of tensions in the ruling coalition. During the election of 1977 Den Uyl served as Lijsttrekker but following a difficult cabinet formation failed to create a new coalition. Den Uyl left office following the installation of the First Van Agt Cabinet on 19 December 1977 but continued to serve in the House of Representatives as Parliamentary leader. For the election of 1981 Den Uyl again served as Lijsttrekker and following a cabinet formation with his successor the leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal Dries van Agt formed the Second Van Agt Cabinet with Den Uyl appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Affairs and Employment taking office on 11 September 1981. The cabinet fell just seven months into its term and was replaced with the caretaker Third Van Agt Cabinet with Den Uyl resigning on 29 May 1982. For the election of 1982 Den Uyl again served as Lijsttrekker and returned to the House of Representatives as Parliamentary leader taking office on 16 September 1982. For the election of 1986 Den Uyl once again served as Lijsttrekker but shortly thereafter announced he was stepping down as Leader on 21 July 1986 and endorsed former trade union leader Wim Kok as his successor though continued to serve in the House of Representatives as a backbencher. In October 1987 Den Uyl was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and died just three months later at the age of 68. Den Uyl was known for his abilities as a skillful debater and as an idealistic and determined leader. During his premiership his cabinet were responsible for major social reforms and dealing with several major crises such as the 1973 oil crisis the Lockheed scandal Moluccans incidents and the fallout of the Yom Kippur War.
